<h5>A LECTURE</h5>

<center><small>On the Providence of God in the Government of the World.</small></center>
<br>

<p>When I consider my own weakness and the discerning judgment of those 
who are to be my audience, I cannot help blaming myself considerably 
for this rash undertaking of mine, being a thing I am altogether 
unpracticed in and very much unqualified for; but I am especially 
discouraged when I reflect that you are all my intimate pot 
companions, who have heard me say a thousand silly things in 
conversation, and therefore have not that laudable partiality and 
veneration for whatever I shall deliver that good people commonly 
have for their spiritual guides; that you have no reverence for my 
habit nor for the sanctity of my countenance; that you do not 
believe me inspired or divinely assisted, and therefore will think 
yourselves at liberty to assert or dissert, approve or disapprove of 
any thing I advance, canvassing and sifting it as the private 
opinion of one of your acquaintance. These are great disadvantages 
and discouragements, but I am entered and must proceed, humbly 
requesting your patience and attention.</p>

<p>I propose at this time to discourse on the subject of our last 
conversation, the Providence of God in the government of the world. 
It might be judged an affront to your understandings should I go 
about to prove this first principle, the existence of a Deity, and 
that he is the Creator of the Universe, for that would suppose you 
ignorant of what all mankind in all ages have agreed in. I shall 
therefore proceed to observe that he must be a being of infinite 
wisdom, as appears in his admirable order and disposition of things, 
whether we consider the heavenly bodies, the stars and planets and 
their wonderful regular motions, or this earth compounded of such an 
excellent mixture of all the elements; or the admirable structure of 
animate bodies of such infinite variety, and yet every one adapted 
to its nature and the way of life it is to be placed in, whether on 
earth, in the air, or in the water, and so exactly that the highest 
and most exquisite human reason cannot find a fault and say this 
would have been better so, or in such a manner, which whoever 
considers attentively and thoroughly will be astonished and 
swallowed up in admiration.</p>

<p>That the Deity is a being of great goodness, appears in his giving 
life to so many creatures each of which acknowledge it a benefit, by 
their unwillingness to leave it; in his providing plentiful 
sustenance for them all, and making those things that are most 
useful, most common and easy to be had; such as water, necessary for 
almost every creature to drink; air, without which few could 
subsist; the inexpressible benefits of light and sunshine to almost 
all animals in general; and to men the most useful vegetable such as 
corn, the most useful of metals as iron &amp;c. the most useful animals 
as horses, oxen and sheep he has made easiest to raise or procure in 
quantity or numbers; each of which particulars, if considered 
seriously and carefully, would fill us with the highest love and affection.</p>

<p>That he is a being of infinite power appears in his being able to 
form and compound such vast masses of matter, as this earth and the 
sun and innumerable stars and planets, and give them such prodigious 
motion, and yet so to govern them in their greatest velocity as that 
they shall not fly out of their appointed bounds, nor dash one 
against another for their mutual destruction. But 'tis easy to 
conceive his power, when we are convinced of his infinite knowledge 
and wisdom; for if weak and foolish creatures as we are by knowing 
the nature of a few things can produce such wonderful effects; such 
as for instance, by knowing the nature only of nitre and sea salt 
mixed we can make a water which will dissolve the hardest iron, and 
by adding one ingredient more can make another water which will 
dissolve gold, and make the most solid bodies fluid, and by knowing 
the nature of saltpetre, sulphur and charcoal, those mean 
ingredients mixed, we can shake the air in the most terrible manner, 
destroy ships, houses and men at a distance, and in an instant, 
overthrow cities, and rend rocks into a thousand pieces, and level 
the highest mountains; what power must he possess who not only knows 
the nature of every thing in the universe, but can make things of 
new natures with the greatest ease and at his pleasure?</p>

<p>Agreeing then that the world was at first made by a being of 
infinite wisdom, goodness and power, which being we call God, the 
state of things existing at this time must be in one of these four 
following manners&mdash;viz.</p>

<blockquote>1. Either he unchangeably decreed and appointed every thing that 
comes to pass, and left nothing to the course of nature, nor allowed 
any creature free agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Without decreeing any thing he left all to general nature and the 
events of free agency in his creatures which he never alters or 
interrupts; or,</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. He decreed some things unchangeably, and left others to general 
nature and the events of free agency which also he never alters or 
interrupts; or,</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. He sometimes interferes by his particular providence and sets 
aside the effects which would otherwise have been produced by any of 
the above causes.</blockquote>

<p>I shall endeavor to show the first three suppositions to be 
inconsistent, with the common light of reason, and 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"><small><small>[p. 294]</small></small></a></span> that the 
fourth is most agreeable to it and therefore most probably true.</p>

<p>In the first place. If you say he has in the beginning unchangeably 
decreed all things and left nothing to nature or free agency, these 
strange conclusions will necessarily follow, 1. That he is now no 
more a God. It is true indeed before he made such unchangeable 
decree, he was a being of power almighty; but now having determined 
every thing he has divested himself of all further power, he has 
done and has no more to do, he has tied up his hands and has now no 
greater power than an idol of wood or stone; nor can there be any 
more reason for praying to him or worshipping of him than of such an 
idol, for the worshippers can never be better for such worship. 
Then, 2. He has decreed some things contrary to the very notion of a 
wise and good being; such as that some of his creatures or children 
shall do all manner of injury to others, and bring every kind of 
evil upon them without cause; that some of them shall even blaspheme 
him their Creator, in the most horrible manner; and which is still 
more highly absurd, that he has decreed, that the greatest part of 
mankind shall in all ages put up their earnest prayers to him both 
in private and publicly, in great assemblies, when all the while he 
had so determined their fate that he could not possibly grant them 
any benefits on that account, nor could such prayers be in any way 
available. Why then should he ordain them to make such prayers? It 
cannot be imagined that they are of any service to him. Surely it is 
not more difficult to believe the world was made by a God of wood or 
stone, than that the God who made the world should be such a God as this.</p>

<p>In the second place. If you say he has decreed nothing, but left all 
things to general nature and the events of free agency which he 
never alters or interrupts, then these conclusions will follow; he 
must either utterly hide himself from the works of his own hands and 
take no notice at all of their proceedings natural or moral, or he 
must be, as undoubtedly he is, a spectator of every thing, for there 
can be no reason or ground to suppose the first. I say there can be 
no reason to imagine he would make so glorious a universe merely to 
abandon it. In this case imagine the deity looking on and beholding 
the ways of his creatures. Some heroes in virtue he sees are 
incessantly endeavoring the good of others: they labor through vast 
difficulties, they suffer incredible hardships and miseries to 
accomplish this end, in hopes to please a good God, and attain his 
favors which they earnestly pray for, what answer can he make then 
within himself but this? <i>Take the reward chance may give you, I do 
not intermeddle in these affairs.</i> He sees others continually doing 
all manner of evil, and bringing by their actions misery and 
destruction among mankind, what can he say here but this, <i>if chance 
rewards you I shall not punish you, I am not to be concerned.</i> He 
sees the just, the innocent, and the beneficent in the hands of the 
wicked and violent oppressor, and when the good are at the brink of 
destruction they pray to him, <i>Thou O God art mighty and powerful to 
save, help us we beseech thee!</i> He answers, <i>I cannot help you, it 
is none of my business, nor do I at all regard these things.</i> How is 
it possible to believe a wise and an infinitely good being can be 
delighted in this circumstance, and be utterly unconcerned what 
becomes of the beings and things he has created? for thus, we must 
believe him idle and inactive, and that his glorious attributes of 
power, wisdom, and goodness are no more to be made use of.</p>

<p>In the third place. If you say he has decreed some things and left 
others to the events of nature and free agency, which he never 
alters or interrupts; still you <i>un-God</i> him if I may be allowed the 
expression&mdash;he has nothing to do; he can cause us neither good nor 
harm; he is no more to be regarded than a lifeless image, than Dagon 
or Baal, or Bell and the Dragon, and as in both the other 
suppositions foregoing, that being which from its power is most able 
to act, from its wisdom knows best how to act, and from its goodness 
would always certainly act best, is in this opinion supposed to 
become the most inactive of all beings, and remain everlastingly 
idle: an absurdity which when considered or but barely seen, cannot 
be swallowed without doing the greatest violence to common reason 
and all the faculties of the understanding.</p>

<p>We are then necessarily driven to the fourth supposition, that the 
Deity sometimes interferes by his particular Providence, and sets 
aside the events which would otherwise have been produced in the 
course of nature or by the free agency of men, and this is perfectly 
agreeable with what we can know of his attributes and perfections. 
But as some may doubt whether it is possible there should be such a 
thing as free agency in creatures, I shall just offer one short 
argument on that account, and proceed to show how the duty of 
religion necessarily follows the belief of a providence. You 
acknowledge that God is infinitely powerful, wise and good, and also 
a free agent, and you will not deny that he has communicated to us 
part of his wisdom, power and goodness; that is, he has made us in 
some degree, wise, potent and good. And is it then impossible for 
him to communicate any part of his freedom, and make us also in some 
degree free? Is not even his infinite power sufficient for this? I 
should be glad to hear what reason any man can give for thinking in 
that manner. It is sufficient for me to show it is not impossible, 
and no man, I think, can show it is improbable. Much more might be 
offered to demonstrate clearly, that men are in some degree free 
agents and accountable for their actions; however, this I may 
possibly reserve for another separate discourse hereafter, if I find occasion.</p>

<p>Lastly. If God does not sometimes interfere by his providence, it is 
either because he cannot, or because he will not. Which of these 
positions will you choose? There is a righteous nation grievously 
oppressed by a cruel tyrant, they earnestly intreat God to deliver 
them. If you say he cannot, you deny his infinite power, which [you] 
at first acknowledged. If you say he will not, you must directly 
deny his infinite goodness. You are of necessity obliged to allow 
that it is highly reasonable to believe a providence, because it is 
highly absurd to believe otherwise.</p>

<p>Now, if it is unreasonable to suppose it out of the power of the 
Deity to help and favor us particularly, or that we are out of his 
hearing and notice, or that good actions do not procure more of his 
favor than ill ones; then I conclude, that believing a providence, 
we have the foundation of all true religion, for we should love and 
revere that Deity for his goodness, and thank him for his benefits; 
we should adore him for his wisdom, fear him for his power, and pray 
to him for his favor and protection. And this religion will be a 
powerful <span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"><small><small>[p. 295]</small></small></a></span>
regulator of our actions, give us peace and 
tranquillity within our own minds, and render us benevolent, useful 
and beneficial to others.</p>

<h5>LETTER FROM ANTHONY AFTERWIT.</h5>
<br>
<p><i>Mr. Gazetteer</i>,&mdash;I am an honest tradesman who never meant harm to 
any body. My affairs went on smoothly while a bachelor; but of late 
I have met with some difficulties of which I take the freedom to 
give you an account.</p>

<p>About the time I first addressed my present spouse, her father gave 
out in speeches that if she married a man he liked, he would give 
with her 200<i>l</i>. in cash on the day of marriage. He never said so 
much to me, it is true, but he always received me very kindly at his 
house, and openly countenanced my courtship. I formed several fine 
schemes what to do with this same 200<i>l</i>. and in some measure 
neglected my business on that account; but unluckily it came to pass 
that when the old gentleman saw I was pretty well engaged and that 
the match was too far gone to be easily broke off, he without any 
reason given, grew very angry, forbid me the house, and told his 
daughter that if she married me he would not give her a farthing. 
However (as he thought) we were not to be disappointed in that 
manner, but having stole a wedding I took her home to my house, 
where we were not in quite so poor a condition as the couple 
described in the Scotch song, who had</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem2">
	<tr><td><small>Neither pot nor pan<br>
  But four bare legs together,</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>for I had a house tolerably furnished for a poor man, before. No 
thanks to Dad, who, I understand, was very much pleased with his 
politic management; and I have since learned that there are other 
old curmudgeons (so called) besides him, who have this trick to 
marry their daughters, and yet keep what they might well spare, till 
they can keep it no longer. But this by way of digression, a word to 
the wise is enough.</p>

<p>I soon saw that with ease and industry we might live tolerably easy 
and in credit with our neighbors; but my wife had a strong 
inclination to be a gentlewoman. In consequence of this, my old 
fashioned looking glass was one day broke, as she said, <i>no one 
could tell which way</i>. However, since we could not be without a 
glass in the room, <i>My dear</i>, saith she, <i>we may as well buy a large 
fashionable one that Mr. Such-a-one has to sell. It will cost but 
little more than a common glass, and will look much handsomer and 
more creditable.</i> Accordingly, the glass was bought and hung against 
the wall, but in a week's time I was made sensible by little and 
little, that <i>the table was by no means suitable to such a glass;</i> 
and a more proper table being procured, some time after, my spouse, 
who was an excellent contriver, informed me where we might have very 
handsome chairs <i>in the way;</i> and thus by degrees I found all my old 
furniture stowed up in the garret, and every thing below altered for 
the better.</p>

<p>Had we stopped here it might have done well enough. But my wife 
being entertained with tea by the good women she visited, we could 
do no less than the like when they visited us, and so we got a tea 
table with all its appurtenances of china and silver. Then my spouse 
unfortunately overworked herself in washing the house, so that we 
could do no longer without a maid. Besides this, it happened 
frequently that when I came home at one, the dinner was but just put 
in the pot, and <i>my dear thought really it had been but eleven</i>. At 
other times when I came at the same hour, <i>she wondered I would stay 
so long, for dinner was ready about one and had waited for me these 
two hours</i>. These irregularities occasioned by mistaking the time 
convinced me that it was absolutely necessary <i>to buy a clock</i>, 
which my spouse observed was <i>a great ornament to the room</i>. And 
lastly, to my grief, she was troubled with some ailment or other, 
and <i>nothing did her so much good as riding, and these hackney 
horses were such wretched ugly creatures that</i>&mdash;I bought a very fine 
pacing mare which cost 20<i>l</i>.; and hereabouts affairs have stood for 
about a twelvemonth past.</p>

<p>I could see all along that this did not at all suit with my 
circumstances, but had not resolution enough to help it, till lately 
receiving a very severe dun which mentioned the next court, I began 
in earnest to project relief. Last Monday, my dear went over the 
river to see a relation and stay a fortnight, because she could not 
bear the heat of the town air. In the interim I have taken my turn 
to make alterations, viz.&mdash;I have turned away the maid, bag and 
baggage&mdash;(for what should we do with a maid, who beside our boy, 
have none but ourselves?) I have sold the pacing mare and bought a 
good milch cow with 3<i>l</i>. of the money. I have disposed of the table 
and put a good spinning wheel in its place, which methinks looks 
very pretty: nine empty canisters I have stuffed with flax, and with 
some of the money of the tea furniture I have bought a set of 
knitting needles, for to tell you the truth <i>I begin to want 
stockings</i>. The fine clock I have transformed into an hour glass, by 
which I have gained a good round sum, and one of the pieces of the 
old looking glass squared and framed, supplies the place of the 
great one, which I have conveyed into a closet where it may possibly 
remain some years. In short the face of things is quite changed, and 
methinks you would smile to see my hour glass hanging in the place 
of the clock,&mdash;what a great ornament it is to the room! I have paid 
my debts and find money in my pocket. I expect my dear home next 
Friday, and as your paper is taken at the house where she is, I hope 
the reading of this will prepare her mind for the above surprising 
revolutions. If she can conform herself to this new manner of 
living, we shall be the happiest couple perhaps in the province, and 
by the blessing of God may soon be in thriving circumstances. I have 
reserved the great glass because I know her heart is set upon it; I

<h5>LETTER FROM CELIA SINGLE.</h5>
<br>
<p><i>Mr. Gazetteer</i>,&mdash;I must needs tell you that some of the things you 
print do more harm than good, particularly I think so of the 
tradesman's letter, which was in one of your late papers, which 
disobliged many of our sex and has broken the peace of several 
families, by causing difference between men and their wives. I shall 
give you here one instance of which I was an eye and ear witness.</p>

<p>Happening last Wednesday morning to be at Mrs. W.'s when her husband 
returned from market, among other things he showed her some balls of 
thread which he had bought. My dear, says he, I like mightily those 
stockings which I yesterday saw neighbor Afterwit knitting for her 
husband, of thread of her own spinning. I should be glad to have 
some such stockings myself. I understand that your maid Mary is a 
very good knitter, and seeing this thread in market I have bought it 
that the girl may make a pair or two for me. Mrs. W. was just then 
at the glass dressing her head, and turning about with the pins in 
her mouth, Lord, child, says she, are you crazy? What time has Mary 
to knit? Who must do the work, I wonder, if you set her to knitting? 
Perhaps, my dear, says he, you have a mind to knit them yourself. I 
remember, when I courted you, I once heard you say that you had 
learned to knit of your mother. I knit stockings for you, says she, 
not I, truly! There are poor women enough in town who can knit; if 
you please you may employ them. Well, but my dear, says he, you know 
a penny saved is a penny got, and there is neither sin nor shame in 
knitting a pair of stockings; why should you have such a mighty 
aversion to it? And what signifies talking of poor women, you know 
we are not people of quality. We have no income to maintain us but 
arises from my labor and industry. Methinks you should not be at all 
displeased when you have an opportunity of getting something as well 
as myself. I wonder, says she, you can propose such a thing to me. 
Did not you always tell me you would maintain me like a gentlewoman? 
If I had married the Captain I am sure he would have scorned to 
mention knitting of stockings. Prythee, says he, a little nettled, 
what do you tell me of your Captain? If you could have had him I 
suppose you would, or perhaps you did not like him very well. If I 
did promise to maintain you as a gentlewoman, methinks it is time 
enough for that when you know how to behave yourself like one. How 
long, do you think, I can maintain you at your present rate of 
living? Pray, says she, somewhat fiercely, and dashing the puff into 
the powder box, dont use me in this manner, for I'll assure you I 
wont bear it. This is the fruit of your poison newspapers: there 
shall no more come here I promise you. Bless us, says he, what an 
unaccountable thing is this? Must a tradesman's daughter and the 
wife of a tradesman necessarily be a lady? In short, I tell you if I 
am forced to work for a living and you are too good to do the like, 
there's the door, go and live upon your estate. And as I never had 
or could expect any thing with you, I dont desire to be troubled 
with you.</p>

<p>What answer she made I cannot tell, for knowing that man and wife 
are apt to quarrel more violently when before strangers, than when 
by themselves, I got up and went out hastily. But I understand from 
Mary who came to me of an errand in the evening, that they dined 
together very peaceably and lovingly, the balls of thread which had 
caused the disturbance being thrown into the kitchen fire, of which 
I was very glad to hear.</p>

<p>I have several times in your paper seen reflections upon us women 
for idleness and extravagance, but I do not remember to have once 
seen such animadversions upon the men. If we were disposed to be 
censorious we could furnish you with instances enough; I might 
mention Mr. Billiard who loses more than he earns at the green 
table, and would have been in jail long since had it not been for 
his industrious wife. Mr. Husselcap, who every market day at least, 
and often all day long, leaves his business for the rattling of half 
pence in a certain alley&mdash;or Mr. Finikin, who has seven different 
suits of fine clothes and wears a change every day, while his wife 
and children sit at home half naked&mdash;Mr. Crownhim always dreaming 
over the chequer board, and who cares not how the world goes with 
his family so he does but get the game&mdash;Mr. Totherpot the tavern 
haunter, Mr. Bookish the everlasting reader, Mr. Tweedledum and 
several others, who are mighty diligent at any thing besides their 
proper business. I say, if I were disposed to be censorious, I might 
mention all these and more, but I hate to be thought a scandalizer 
of my neighbors, and therefore forbear; and for your part I would 
advise you for the future to entertain your readers with something 
else besides people's reflections upon one another, for remember 
that there are holes enough to be picked in your coat as well as 
others, and those that are affronted by the satires that you may 
publish, will not consider so much who wrote as who printed, and 
treat you accordingly. Take not this freedom amiss from</p>

<br>
<br>
<h4>GENIUS.</h4>
<br>

<p>Pope says in the preface to his works, "What we call a genius is 
hard to be distinguished, by a man himself, from a strong 
inclination." Such a distinction is certainly hard to make, and in 
my opinion has no existence. Genius, as it appears to me, is merely 
a decided preference for any study or pursuit, which enables its 
possessor to give the close and unwearied attention necessary to 
ensure success. When this constancy of purpose is wanting, the 
brightest natural talents will give little aid in acquiring literary 
or scientific eminence: and where it exists in any considerable 
degree, it is rare to find one so ill endowed with common sense as 
not to gain a respectable standing.</p>

<p>Genius is of two sorts, which may be termed philosophical and 
poetical. When the mind takes most pleasure in the exercise of 
reason, the genius displayed is philosophical; when the fictions of 
fancy give the greatest delight, the cast of mind is poetical. All 
the operations of the human intellect may be referred to one of 
these, or to a combination of both. Books of this last character are 
much the most numerous; for we seldom find a work so severely 
argumentative as to exclude all play of imagination even as 
ornament, or so entirely poetical as never to allow the restraint of 
sober reason.</p>

<p>These two kinds of genius require different and peculiar faculties. 
In philosophy, where the great end proposed is the discovery of 
truth, the coloring of imagination should be carefully avoided as 
useless and deceptive. It is necessary to divest the mind as far as 
possible of all pre-conceived opinions, that so the proofs presented 
may make just the impression which their character and importance 
demand. No prejudice or association of former ideas must be allowed 
to bias the judgment; but the question should be decided in strict 
accordance with the deductions of the sternest reason. And yet this 
perfect freedom from prejudice, however necessary to the proper use 
of right reason, is perhaps the most difficult effort of the human 
mind. "Nemo adhuc," says Lord Bacon, in a passage quoted by Stewart 
in the introduction to his mental philosophy, "Nemo adhuc tanta 
mentis constantia inventus est, ut decreverit et sibi imposuerit 
theorias et notiones communes penitus abolere, et intellectum 
abrasum et æquum ad particularia de integro applicare. Itaque illa 
ratio humana quam habemus ex multa fide et multo etiam casu, necnon 
ex puerilibus quas primo hausimus notionibus, farrago quædam est et 
congeries. Quod si quis, ætate matura et sensibus integris et mente 
repurgata, se ad experientiam et ad particularia de integro 
applicet, de eo melius sperandum est." Such was the opinion of the 
great father of modern philosophy.</p>

<p>On the other hand these vulgar errors and superstitions, these 
"theoriæ et notiones communes," supply the means of producing the 
strongest effect of poetry. The dull scenes of real life can never 
be suffered to chill the ardor of a romantic imagination. And as the 
poet finds truth too plain and unadorned to satisfy his enthusiastic 
fancy, he is compelled to seek subjects and scenery of more 
faultless nature and brighter hues than this world affords. He 
delights in combinations of the most striking images. The grand and 
imposing, the dark and terrific, the furious and 
desolating&mdash;whatever serves to fill the mind with awe and wonder, 
are his favorite subjects of contemplation. The legends of 
superstition contribute largely to the effect of poetical 
composition. The enthusiast loves to fancy the agency of 
supernatural beings, and endeavors to feel the influence of those 
emotions which such a belief is suited to inspire. This seems to be 
the spirit of Collins in the following lines of his ode to fear.</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem4">
	<tr><td><small>"Dark power, with shuddering meek submitted thought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be mine to read the visions old<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thy awakening bards have told;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lest thou meet my blasted view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold each strange tale devoutly true."</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>In combinations of poetical images, no regard is had to their 
consistency with truth and reason. It is the part of philosophy to 
discover relations as they exist in nature; but to search out and 
combine into one glowing and harmonious whole the brightest and 
grandest images which art or nature supplies&mdash;this is the province 
of poetry. The utmost calmness and most collected thought are 
necessary to that patient and laborious reasoning by which progress 
is made in the science of truth. The fury of impassioned feeling, on 
the other hand, supports the loftier flights of poetry. Hence 
philosophy and poetry rarely meet in the same individual. Yet the 
smallness of the number of those who have gained renown both as 
poets and philosophers, is to be ascribed less to any 
incompatibility between the habits of mind peculiar to each, than to 
the fact that the short space of human life will not allow to both 
the attention necessary for their highest attainments. I speak now 
of poetical and philosophical genius, not of poetry and philosophy. 
Between the two last there <i>is</i> an incompatibility, as may easily be 
shown. Euclid's elements, for example, contain as pure specimens of 
mere reasoning as can be conceived; but in them simplicity, 
clearness and precision of terms are all the ornament they need or 
will admit: nor can poetical language be used by any arrangement 
without producing obscurity and disgust. And the wild conceptions of 
unbridled fancy will as little brook the restraint of heartless 
reason. In short, poetry and philosophy are so distinct and opposed 
in character, that neither can ever be used to heighten the proper 
effect of the other.</p>

<p>A most extraordinary combination of poetical and philosophical 
talent in one individual was displayed by Lucretius. I might 
challenge the whole circle of science or literature to furnish 
examples of clearer, closer and more irrefutable argument than his 
work presents. And for purity, sublimity, delicacy, strength and 
feeling, passages of his poetry might be selected scarcely 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"><small><small>[p. 298]</small></small></a></span>
inferior to any effort of ancient or modern times. Yet his work may 
well be chosen to furnish proof that even the brightest genius 
cannot combine austere logic and gorgeous poetry, so as that each 
shall produce its due effect. For although where the reasoning is 
not deep the embellishments of fancy may be borne and even relished, 
yet where the argument requires close and laborious thought, the 
reader is willing to sacrifice all the ornaments of poetry to the 
simpler grace of perspicuity. But it is mostly in episodes and 
illustrations that the fire of his poetic genius burns so brightly; 
and here we see him throw off the fetters of truth to wander in the 
haunted fields of fiction. And although his work displays intense 
thought and burning poetry, we rarely find them united in the same passage.</p>

<p>Confirmed habits of philosophical reflection, it is not improbable, 
will in time give a character of sobriety and apathy to the mind. 
Quick susceptibility of impressions is one mark of a poetical 
temperament; and of course if habits of calm reasoning destroy this 
sensibility, philosophy and poetry cannot exist in perfection in the 
same mind. But this apathetic coldness appears not to be the 
immediate effect of philosophical habits, but rather to result from 
disuse of the imagination while the attention is turned to graver 
studies. Lucretius has shown what attainments may be made in pure 
philosophy without lessening the strength and grace of fancy. He was 
a man of the most acute and accurate observation, and of the most 
rigid and cautious reasoning, yet possessed a quick perception of 
the grand and beautiful, and had imbibed the warmest spirit of 
poetic enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Poetry delights in personifications. According to Dryden,</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem5">
	<tr><td><small>"Each virtue a divinity is seen:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prudence is Pallas, beauty Paphos' queen;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor a rough storm that gives the sailor pain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But angry Neptune ploughing up the main;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo's no more an empty, airy sound,<br>

<p>Philosophy on the contrary seeks to disrobe the subject of every 
factitious charm, and present it to the mind in its naked 
simplicity. It dispels the clouds of error, though gilded with the 
bright colors of fancy; and boldly brings even objects of 
superstitious veneration to the light of reason.</p>

<p>These conflicting qualities are eminently shown in Lucretius; and it 
is not without interest to mark how he contrives to blend in the 
same work the solid simplicity of argument with the lighter graces 
of imagination. As a poet he opens his work with an address to Venus 
the mother and guardian of the Roman people, whose aid he invokes as 
the companion of his song. He prays her to avert the frowns of 
rugged war from the nation by the softening power of her charms. He 
tells her that she alone governs the universe; that nothing springs 
into the light of day without her; and ascribes to her, as the 
source of all pleasure, whatever is joyous or lovely.</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem6">
	<tr><td><small>"Nec sine te quidquam dias in luminis oras<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exoritur, neque fit lætum neque amabile quidquam."</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Yet in the next page the philosopher avows his intention of waging 
eternal war with superstition; and gives exalted praise to Epicurus 
because he suffered no feelings of religious awe to interfere with 
his philosophical investigations. In this passage superstition (or 
religion, to use his own term) is personified, and represented as 
some hideous monster thrusting her head from out the skies, and 
regarding mankind with an awful and terrible aspect. The whole image 
presented is eminently grand and poetic.</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem7">
	<tr><td><small>"Humana ante oculos fede quam vita jaceret<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In terris oppressa gravi sub religione;<br>

</table>

<p>Thus we see that although one great part of his purpose was to 
divest the mind of popular superstitions, he found the language of 
philosophy too barren, and the images which truth presented too cold 
and lifeless to supply the materials of poetry. Hence his 
personifications, and his digressions, which abound in the richest 
ornaments of fancy.</p>

<p>As a philosopher Lucretius was led to reject the legends of ancient 
superstition, because such terrors kept the human mind in darkness 
and error.</p>

<p>But the spirit of poetry alone would have persuaded him to increase 
the gloom and mists of superstition; for fancy's favorite range is 
among regions darkened by the shades of ancient and venerable error. 
The intrusion of cold reason is always unwelcome to a romantic 
imagination. There is a passage of Campbell, (I cannot remember the 
words,) in which he laments the dispersion by the clearer light of 
reason of some fanciful notions in regard, I think, to the rainbow, 
which had formerly been the delight of his youth. Collins too 
regrets the restraint of imagination imposed by philosophy. He bids 
farewell to metaphysics, and declares his purpose of leaving such 
barren fields of speculation, and of retiring</p>

</table>

<p>So much to mark the difference between poetical and philosophical 
genius. The remainder of this essay shall be devoted to the 
peculiarities which distinguish the genius of poetry in particular.</p>

<p>It has been often remarked that men of brilliant fancy are never 
satisfied with the productions of their own minds. The images of 
grandeur or beauty continually present to their imaginations, it 
would seem, are so far superior to all efforts they can make to 
embody them in language, that their own works never yield them the 
pleasure which they give others. The following quotation is from the 
seventh chapter, sixth section, of Stewart's Elements of the 
Philosophy of the Human 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"><small><small>[p. 299]</small></small></a></span>
Mind. "When the notions of enjoyment 
or of excellence which imagination has formed are greatly raised 
above the ordinary standard, they interest the passions too deeply 
to leave us at all times the cool exercise of reason, and produce 
that state of the mind which is commonly known by the name of 
enthusiasm; a temper which is one of the most fruitful sources of 
error and disappointment; but which is a source, at the same time, 
of heroic actions and of exalted characters. To the exaggerated 
conceptions of eloquence which perpetually revolved in the mind of 
Cicero; to that idea which haunted his thoughts of <i>aliquid immensum 
infinitumque</i>, we are indebted for some of the most splendid 
displays of human genius: and it is probable that something of the 
same kind has been felt by every man who has risen much above the 
level of humanity either in speculation or in action." To the want 
of this high imaginary standard of excellence, Dr. Johnson ascribes 
the dullness of Blackmore's poetry. "It does not appear," he says, 
"that he saw beyond his own performances, or had ever elevated his 
views to that ideal perfection which every genius born to excel is 
condemned always to pursue and never overtake. In the first 
suggestions of his imagination he acquiesced; he thought them good 
and did not seek for better. His works may be read a long time 
without the occurrence of a single line that stands prominent from 
the rest."</p>

<p>Examples of such ardent aspirations after the <i>grande et immensum</i>, 
are frequent among our best poets. Let the following from Lord Byron 
suffice. In this will plainly appear that <i>agony</i> in giving birth to 
the sublime conceptions of his imagination, which metaphysicians say 
is a sure mark of lofty genius. After describing a terrific 
thunderstorm in language suited to the majesty of his subject, he 
proceeds:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem10">
	<tr><td><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Could I embody and unbosom now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which is most within me,&mdash;could I wreak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I would have sought, and all I seek,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear, know, feel, and yet breathe&mdash;into <i>one</i> word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that one word were lightning, I would speak;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as it is, I live and die unheard,<br>
  With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword."</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The same burning enthusiasm prevails throughout the odes of Collins, 
whose works breathe as much the soul of poetry as is shown by any 
bard of Greece or Rome.</p>

<p>This trait of genius often betrays young writers into a style of 
affected grandiloquence, which their feebleness of thought makes 
doubly ridiculous. Yet this pompous style of writing is often a 
genuine mark of superior powers. Quintilian thinks extravagance a 
more favorable sign in a very young writer, than a more sedate 
simplicity; for his maturer judgment may be safely left to prune 
such luxuriance, but where the soil is barren by nature, no art of 
cultivation will produce a vigorous growth. Scarcely any writer was 
ever guilty of more extravagance than Lucan; but his poem was 
written in the earliest spring of manhood, and shows such strength 
of genius as would probably have made him equal to Homer, had his 
rising powers been suffered to reach their utmost elevation, and 
receive the corrections of his finished taste.</p>

<p>But here it may not be amiss to mention that a style of such 
affected pomp is tolerable only in young writers. When the fancy is 
fresh and vigorous, and the judgment unformed, redundance in words 
and ornament may be pardoned; but it is a sure evidence of feeble 
genius to continue the same style in riper age. Hortensius, Cicero's 
rival, was in his youth admired for his florid oratory; but in after 
life was justly despised for the same childish taste. The most 
elegant writers always select the simplest words. Learning should 
appear in the subject, but never in the language. Even the powers of 
Johnson were too weak to preserve his ponderous learned style from 
ridicule. It may be assumed as a universal rule, that when two words 
equally express the same meaning, the shortest and simplest is 
always the best.</p>

<p>When the enthusiasm of poetry is joined with a correct and chastened 
judgment, the utmost fastidiousness in composition is often 
produced. To this may be ascribed the small number and extent of 
writings left by some of our best authors. "I am tormented with a 
desire to write better than I can," said Robert Hall in a letter to 
a friend: and yet his works are said by Dugald Stewart (himself an 
admirable writer in point of style) to combine the beauties of 
Addison, Johnson and Burke, without their defects, and to contain 
the purest specimens of the English language. And of Pascal too, it 
is told that he spent much time in revising and correcting what to 
others appeared from the first almost too perfect for amendment. 
Gray, who had genius to become a pre-eminent poet, was never content 
with the polish which repeated revisions were able to give his 
works. The conclusion of Boileau's second Satire is so appropriate 
to my purpose, that I will give it in full.</p>

<p>And in a note on this passage, "Voila, s'écria Molière, en 
interrompant son ami a cet endroit, voila la plus belle vérité que 
vous ayez jamais dite. Je ne suis pas du nombre de ces esprits 
sublimes dont vous parlez; mais tel que je suis, je n'ai rien fait 
en ma vie dont je sois veritablement content." Horace too speaks 
much the same language in several places.</p>

<p>Of Shakspeare, the greatest poetical genius probably which the world 
ever produced, our ignorance of his life permits us to speak only 
from his works. But the fact that he scarcely ever condescended to 
revise his plays, and took no care to preserve them from oblivion, 
is ample proof how little his mind was satisfied with its own 
sublime productions. Shakspeare is an illustrious example of 
transcendent genius joined with unfinished taste. He had to depend 
entirely on his own resources, for the best models he had access to 
were not more faultless than his own writings, while they fell 
infinitely below him in every positive excellence. His works, in 
parts, show sublimity, delicacy, and grace of poetry, unequalled 
perhaps by the productions of any writer before or since. Yet his 
warmest admirers are often scandalized by the strange conceited 
witticisms and other evidences of bad taste so abundant in his 
writings. Still, the Bard of Avon's works will ever rank among the 
noblest efforts of dramatic poetry.</p>

<p>Poetical genius is always united with a love of 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"><small><small>[p. 300]</small></small></a></span> sympathy. This 
is the reason why men of warm imaginations so seldom fully relish a 
poem when read alone. Robert Hall, in one remarkable passage, says, 
that the most ardent admirer of poetry or oratory would not consent 
to witness their grandest display on the sole condition that he 
should never reveal his emotions.</p>

<p>It is also generally, and perhaps always, joined with a thirst of 
fame. This feeling impels the poet to make arduous exertions. It is 
the passion which, as metaphysicians say, is implanted in the human 
breast as an incentive to deeds beneficial to society. Whether it be 
in its nature culpable or not, is perhaps a difficult question. 
Quintilian says that if it be not itself a virtue, it is certainly 
often the cause of virtuous actions; and this assertion few will 
venture to question. And at all events, this passion has ever been a 
characteristic of the greatest men. Few have risen to eminence 
without its aid. It existed largely in Byron. In verses written 
shortly after the publication of his English Bards and Scotch 
Reviewers, he says:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem12">
	<tr><td><small>"The fire in the cavern of Ætna concealed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still mantles unseen in its secret recess;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At length in a volume terrific revealed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No torrent can quench it, no bounds can repress.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, thus the desire in my bosom for fame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bids me live but to hope for posterity's praise:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I soar with the Phœnix on pinions of flame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him I could wish to expire in the blaze."</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>How happy for the world had his genius led him to seek applause in 
works designed for the good of mankind&mdash;in recommending religion and 
virtue by the melody of his verse and the influence of his life, 
instead of adorning vice with the beauties of poetry!</p>

<p>When the thirst of glory is disappointed, the aspirant is apt to 
become a gloomy misanthropist, who envies others the reputation 
which he cannot attain. Much of the sullen melancholy shown by men 
of genius may doubtless be ascribed to the perverted operation of 
this principle. The portion of fame which falls to their share is 
not sufficient to satisfy their wishes.</p>

<p>But after all, the most brilliant genius will avail nothing without 
study. No illiterate man ever gained renown as a writer. Some have 
become great without the aid of foreign learning; but all have read 
and thought. No man is born a poet in the ordinary sense of the 
word. Whatever his own conceptions may be, he cannot reveal them 
without the use of words; and this knowledge can be acquired only by 
diligent study. In all time it has been true that they who have read 
and thought most, have made the greatest writers, whatever line of 
science or literature they pursued. Or perhaps there ought to be 
exceptions made in cases where the mind has been misdirected, as 
among the schoolmen, who spent their lives in perplexing themselves 
and others with subtle questions which it was of no use to solve. 
But however fruitless such labors as wasted their energies may be, 
this at least is certain, that without study no man will become 
great, whatever be his natural talents. Even such towering geniuses 
as Homer, Aristotle, Cicero, Virgil, Shakspeare, Bacon, Newton, and 
Byron were not exempt from this necessity.</p>

<p>To conclude: Locke has sufficiently proved that all our ideas are 
originally derived from the senses. These first impressions form the 
basis of all human knowledge. General conclusions drawn from 
comparison of such sensations are abstract thought. Reasoning and 
reflection on these abstract ideas thus obtained, constitute 
speculations of still greater refinement. Comparing and combining 
ideas in the mind, for the purpose of discovering relations as they 
exist in nature, is argument. Such comparisons and combinations made 
for the purpose of pleasing, are works of fancy, or poetry. He then 
who most carefully preserves his impressions, most attentively 
considers and revolves his ideas, and most closely and accurately 
compares them for the purpose of discovering such combinations as 
nature has made, or of combining anew the separate images into such 
grand and beautiful fabrics as may suit the taste of fancy, is 
likely to make the best philosopher or poet, as his attention is 
mainly turned to one or the other. Some difference in natural 
faculties no doubt exists, but this is probably small.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small></p>

<h4>SOME ANCIENT GREEK AUTHORS.</h4>
<center><small>CHRONOLOGICALLY ARRANGED.</small></center>
<br>

<p>Whether Homer or Hesiod lived first has never been determined. 
Herodotus supposes them both to have lived at the same time, viz. 
B.C. 884. The Arun. marbles make them contemporaries, but place 
their era B.C. 907. Besides the Iliad and Odyssey, Homer wrote, 
according to some, a poem upon Amphiaraus' expedition against 
Thebes; Also, the Phoceis, the Cercopes, the small Iliad, the 
Epiciclides, the Batrachomyomachia, and some Hymns to the Gods.</p>

<p><i>Hesiod</i> wrote a poem on Agriculture, called The Works and Days, 
also Theogony, which is valuable for its account of the Gods of 
antiquity. His Shield of Hercules, and some others, are now lost.</p>

<p><i>Archilocus</i> wrote elegies, satires, odes and epigrams, and was the 
inventor of Iambics; these are by some ascribed to Epodes. Some 
fragments of his poetry remain. He is supposed to have lived B.C. 742.</p>

<p><i>Alcæus</i> is the inventor of Alcaic verses. Of all his works, nothing 
remains but a few fragments, found in Athenæus. B.C. 600.</p>

<p>He was contemporary with the famous Sappho. She was the inventress 
of the Sapphic verse, and had composed nine books in lyric verses, 
besides epigrams, elegies, &amp;c. Of all these, two pieces alone 
remain, and a few fragments quoted by Didymus.</p>

<p><i>Theognis</i> of Megara wrote several poems, of which only a few 
sentences are now extant, quoted by Plato and some others. B.C. 548.</p>

<p><i>Simonides</i> wrote elegies, epigrams and dramatical pieces; also Epic 
poems&mdash;one on Cambyses, King of Persia, &amp;c. One of his most famous 
compositions, The Lamentations, a beautiful fragment, is still extant.</p>

<p><i>Thespis</i>, supposed to be the inventor of Tragedy, lived about this time.</p>

<p><i>Anacreon</i>. His odes are thought to be still extant, but very few of 
them can be truly ascribed to Anacreon.</p>

<p><i>Æschylus</i> is the first who introduced two actors on the stage, and 
clothed them with suitable dresses. He likewise removed murder from 
the eyes of the spectator. He wrote 90 tragedies, of which 7 are 
extant, viz. Prometheus Vinctus, Septem Duces contra Thebas, Persæ, 
Agamemnon, Chöephoræ, Eumenides and Supplices.</p>

<p><i>Pindar</i> was his contemporary. Most of Pindar's works have perished. 
He had written some hymns to the Gods,&mdash;poems in honor of 
Apollo,&mdash;dithyrambics to Bacchus, and odes on several victories 
obtained at the Olympic, Isthmian, Pythian and Nemean games. Of all 
these the odes alone remain.</p>

<p><i>Sophocles</i> first increased the number of actors to three, and added 
the decorations of painted scenery. He composed 120 tragedies&mdash;7 
only of which are extant, viz. Ajax, Electra, Œdipus, Antigone, The 
Trachniæ, Philoctetes and Œdipus at Colonos. B.C. 454.</p>

<p><i>Plato</i>, the comic poet, called the prince of the middle comedy, and 
of whose pieces some fragments remain, flourished about this time.</p>

<p>Also, <i>Aristarchus</i>, the tragic poet of Tegea, who composed 70 
tragedies, one of which was translated into Latin verse by Ennius.</p>

<p><i>Herodotus</i> of Halicarnassus, wrote a history of the Wars of the 
Greeks against the Persians from the age of Cyrus to the battle of 
Mycale, including an account of the most celebrated nations in the 
world. Besides this, he had written a history of Assyria and Arabia 
which is not extant. There is a life of Homer generally attributed 
to him, but doubtfully. B.C. 445.</p>

<p><i>Euripides</i>, who lived at this time, wrote 75 or, as some say, 92 
tragedies, of which only 19 are extant. He was the rival of Sophocles.</p>

<p>About the commencement of the Peloponnesian war, flourished many 
celebrated authors, among whom was <i>Aristophanes</i>. He wrote 54 
comedies, of which only 11 are extant.</p>

<p>Also, <i>Cratinus</i> and <i>Eupolis</i>, who with Aristophanes, are mentioned 
by Horace&mdash;they were celebrated for their comic writings. B.C. 431.</p>

<p>Also, the mathematician and astrologer, <i>Meton</i>, who, in a book 
called Enneadecaterides, endeavored to adjust the course of the sun 
and moon, and maintained that the solar and lunar years could 
regularly begin from the same point in the heavens. This is called 
the Metonic cycle.</p>

<p><i>Thucydides</i> flourished at this time. He wrote a history of the 
important events which happened during his command. This history is 
continued only to the 21st year of the war. It has been divided into 
eight books&mdash;the last of which is supposed to have been written by 
his daughters. It is imperfect.</p>

<p>Also <i>Hippocrates;</i>&mdash;few of his writings remain.</p>

<p><i>Lysias</i>, the orator, wrote, according to Plutarch, no less than 425 
orations&mdash;of these 34 are extant. B.C. 404.</p>

<p>Contemporary with him was <i>Agatho</i>, an Athenian tragic and comic 
poet&mdash;there is now nothing extant of his works, except quotations in 
Aristotle and others.</p>

<p><i>Xenophon</i>, whose works are well known, lived about the year 398 
before Christ.</p>

<p><i>Ctesias</i>, who wrote a history of the Assyrians and Persians, which 
Justin and Diodorus have prefered to that of Herodotus, lived also 
at this time. Some fragments of his compositions have been preserved.</p>

<p>The works of <i>Plato</i> are numerous&mdash;they are all written, except 
twelve letters, in the form of a dialogue. 388.</p>

<p>Of the 64 orations of Isæus, 10 are extant. Demosthenes imitated 
him. 377.</p>

<p>About 32 of the orations of <i>Isocrates</i>, who lived at the same time, remain.</p>

<p>All the compositions of the historian <i>Theopompus</i> are lost, except 
a few fragments quoted by ancient writers. 354.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"><small><small>[p. 302]</small></small></a></span>
<p><i>Ephorus</i> lived in his time&mdash;he wrote a history commencing 
with the return of the Heraclidæ and ending with the 20th year of 
Philip of Macedon. It was in 30 books and is frequently quoted by 
Strabo and others.</p>

<p>Almost all the writings of <i>Aristotle</i> are extant. Diogenes Laertes 
has given a catalogue of them. His Art of Poetry has been imitated 
by Horace.</p>

<p><i>Æschines</i>, his contemporary, wrote 5 orations and 9 epistles. The 
orations alone are extant. 340.</p>

<p><i>Demosthenes</i> was his contemporary and rival.</p>

<p><i>Theophrastus</i> composed many books and treatises&mdash;Diogenes 
enumerates 200. Of these 20 are extant&mdash;among which are a history of 
stones&mdash;treatises on plants, on the winds, signs of fair weather, 
&amp;c.&mdash;also, his Characters, a moral treatise. 320.</p>

<p><i>Menander</i> was his pupil; lie was called prince of the new comedy. 
Only a few fragments remain of 108 comedies which he wrote.</p>

<p><i>Philemon</i> was contemporary with these two. The fragments of some of 
his comedies are printed with those of Menander.</p>

<p><i>Megasthenes</i> lived about this time. He wrote about the Indians and 
other oriental nations. His history is often quoted by the ancients. 
There is a work now extant which passes for his composition, but 
which is spurious.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus</i> also lived now. He wrote 300 volumes according to 
Diogenes.</p>

<p><i>Chrysippus</i> indeed, rivalled him in the number, but not in the 
merit of his productions. They were contemporaries. 280.</p>

<p><i>Bion</i>, the pastoral poet, whose Idyllia are so celebrated, lived 
about this time. It is probable that <i>Moschus</i>, also a pastoral 
poet, was his contemporary&mdash;from the affection with which he 
mentions him.</p>

<p><i>Theocritus</i> distinguished himself by his poetical compositions, of 
which 30 Idyllia and some epigrams remain&mdash;also, a ludicrous poem 
called Syrinx. Virgil imitated him. B.C. 280.</p>

<p><i>Aratus</i> flourished now; he wrote a poem on Astronomy, also some 
hymns and epigrams.</p>

<p><i>Lycophron</i> also lived at this time. The titles of 20 of his 
tragedies are preserved. There is extant a strange work of this 
poet, call Cassandra, or Alexandra,&mdash;it contains about 1500 verses, 
from whose obscurity the author has been named Tenebrosus.</p>

<p>In the Anthology is preserved a most beautiful hymn to Jupiter, 
written by <i>Cleanthes</i>,&mdash;of whose writings none except this is 
preserved.</p>

<p><i>Manetho</i> lived about this period,&mdash;an Egyptian who wrote, in the 
Greek language, a history of Egypt. The writers of the Universal 
History suspect some mistake in the passage of Eusebius which 
contains an account of this history.</p>

<p>This was also the age of <i>Apollonius</i> of Perga, the Geometrician. He 
composed a treatise on conic sections in eight books&mdash;seven of which 
remain. It is one of the most valuable remains of antiquity.</p>

<p><i>Nicander's</i> writings were held in much estimation. Two of his 
poems, entitled Theriaca, and Alexipharniaca, are still extant. He 
is said to have written 5 books of Metamorphoses, which Ovid has 
imitated. He wrote also history. 150.</p>

<p>About this time flourished <i>Polybius</i>. He wrote an universal History 
in Greek, divided into 40 books; which began with the Punic wars, 
and finished with the conquest of Macedonia by Paulus. This is lost, 
except the first 5 books, and fragments of the 12 following. Livy 
has copied whole books from him, almost word for word&mdash;and thinks 
proper to call him in return "haudquaquam spernendus auctor."</p>

<h4>MARCH COURT.</h4>
<br>

<p>Court day!&mdash;what an important day in Virginia!&mdash;what a day of bustle 
and business!&mdash;what a requisition is made upon every mode of 
conveyance to the little metropolis of the county! How many debts 
are then to be paid!&mdash;how many to be <i>put off!</i>&mdash;Alas! how 
preponderate the latter! If a man says "<i>I will pay you at Court</i>," 
I give up the debt as hopeless, without the intervention of the 
<i>la</i>. But if court day be thus important, how much more so is March 
court! That is the day when our candidates are expected home from 
Richmond to give an account of their stewardship; at least it used 
to be so, before the number of our legislators was lessened with a 
view of facilitating the transaction of business, and with a promise 
of <i>shortening</i> the sessions. But somehow or other, the public chest 
has such a multitude of charms, it seems now to be more impossible 
than ever to get away from it.</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem15">
	<tr><td><small>"'Tis that capitol rising in grandeur on high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where bank notes, by thousands, bewitchingly lie,"</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>as the song says, which makes our sessions "<i>of so long a life</i>," 
and there is no practicable mode of preventing the <i>evisceration</i> of 
the aforesaid chest, but deferring the meeting of the Assembly to 
the month of February, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"><small><small>[p. 303]</small></small></a></span>
and thereby compelling the performance 
of the Commonwealth's business within the two months which would 
intervene till the planting of corn. However, this is foreign to my 
present purpose, which is to describe a scene at which I have often 
gazed with infinite amusement. Would I had the power of Hogarth, 
that I might perpetuate the actings and doings of a March court; but 
having no turn that way, I must barely attempt to group the 
materials, and leave the painting to some regular artist to perfect. 
Picture to yourself, my gentle reader, our little town of 
<i>Dumplinsburg</i>, consisting of a <i>store</i>, a <i>tavern</i>, and a 
<i>blacksmith shop</i>, the common ingredients of a county town, with a 
court house and a jail in the foreground, as denoting the superior 
respect to which they are entitled. Imagine a number of roads 
diverging from the town like the radii of a circle, and upon these 
roads horsemen and footmen of every imaginable kind, moving, helter 
skelter, to a single point of attraction. Justices and 
jurymen&mdash;counsellors and clients&mdash;planters and 
pettifoggers&mdash;constables and cakewomen&mdash;farmers and 
felons&mdash;horse-drovers and horse-jockies, and <i>so on</i>, all rushing 
onward like the logs and rubbish upon the current of some mighty 
river swollen by rains, hurrying pell mell to the vast ocean which 
is to swallow them all up&mdash;a simile not altogether unapt, when we 
consider that the greater part of these people have law business, 
and the law is universally allowed to be a vortex worse than the 
Maelstrom. Direct the "fringed curtains of thine eyes" a little 
further to the main street&mdash;a street well entitled to the epithet 
main in all its significations, being in truth the principal and 
only street, and being moreover the political arena or cockpit, in 
which is settled pugilistically, all the tough and knotty points 
which cannot be adjusted by argument. See, on either side, rows of 
nags of all sorts and sizes, from the skeleton just unhitched from 
the plough, to the saucy, fat, impudent pony, with roached mane and 
bobtail, and the sleek and long tailed pampered horse, whose coat 
proclaims his breeding, all tied to the <i>staggering</i> fence which 
constitutes the boundary of the street. Behold the motley assemblage 
within these limits hurrying to and fro with rapid strides, as if 
life were at stake. Who is he who slips about among the "<i>greasy 
rogues</i>," with outstretched palm, and shaking as many hands as the 
Marquis La Fayette? It is the candidate for election, and he 
distributes with liberal hand that <i>barren chronicle</i> of legislative 
deeds, denominated the list of laws, upon which are fed a people 
starving for information. This is a mere register of the titles of 
acts passed at the last session, but it is caught at with avidity by 
the sovereigns, who are highly offended if they do not come in for a 
share of the Delegate's bounty. The purchase and distribution of 
these papers is a sort of <i>carmen necessarium</i>, or indispensable 
lesson, and it frequently happens that a member of the Assembly who 
has been absent from his post the whole winter, except upon the yeas 
and nays, acquires credit for his industry and attention to business 
in proportion to the magnitude of the bundle he distributes of this 
uninstructive record.</p>

<p>See now he mounts some elevated stand and harangues the gaping 
crowd, while a jackass led by his groom is braying at the top of his 
lungs just behind him. The jack takes in his breath, like Fay's 
Snorer, "<i>with the tone of an octave flute, and lets it out with the 
profound depth of a trombone</i>." Wherever a candidate is seen, there 
is sure to be a jackass&mdash;surely, his long eared companion does not 
mean to satirize the candidate! However that may be, you perceive 
the orator is obliged to desist, overwhelmed perhaps by this 
thundering applause. Now the crowd opens to the right and left to 
make way for some superb animal at full trot, some Highflyer or 
Daredevil, who is thus exhibited <i>ad captandum vulgus</i>, which seems 
the common purpose of the candidate, the jack, and his more noble 
competitor. But look&mdash;here approaches an object more terrible than 
all, if we may judge from the dispersion of the crowd who <i>ensconce</i> 
themselves behind every convenient corner and peep from their 
lurking holes, while the object of their dread moves onward with 
saddle bags on arm, a pen behind his ear, and an inkhorn at his 
button hole. Lest some of my readers should be ignorant of this 
august personage, I must do as they do in England, where they take a 
shaggy dog, and dipping him in red paint, they dash him against the 
signboard and write underneath, this is the Red Lion. This is the 
sheriff and he is summoning his jury&mdash;"Mr. Buckskin, you, sir, 
dodging behind the blacksmith's shop, I summon you on the jury;" ah, 
luckless wight! he is caught and obliged to succumb. In vain he begs 
to be let off,&mdash;"you must apply to the magistrates," is the surly 
reply. And if, reader, you could listen to what passes afterwards in 
the court house, you might hear something like the following 
colloquy&mdash;Judge. "What is your excuse, sir?" Juror. "I am a lawyer, 
sir." Judge. "Do you follow the law now, sir?" Juror. "No, sir, the 
law follows me." Judge. "Swear him, Mr. Clerk." Ah, there is a 
battle!!! see how the crowd rushes to the spot&mdash;"who fights?"&mdash;"part 
'em"&mdash;"stand off"&mdash;"fair play"&mdash;"let no man touch"&mdash;"hurrah, 
Dick"&mdash;"at him, Tom." An Englishman thinking himself in England, 
bawls out, "sheriff, read the riot act"&mdash;a Justice comes up and 
commands the peace; <i>inter arma silent leges;</i> he is unceremoniously 
knocked down, and Justice is blind as ought to be the case. Two of 
the rioters now attempt to ride in at the tavern door, and for 
awhile all Pandemonium seems broke loose. To complete this picture, 
I must, like Asmodeus, unroof the court house, and show you a trial 
which I had the good fortune to witness. It was during the last war, 
when the vessels of Admiral Gordon were making their way up the 
Potomac to Alexandria, that a negro woman was arraigned for killing 
one of her own sex and color; she had been committed for murder, but 
the evidence went clearly to establish the deed to be manslaughter, 
inasmuch as it was done in sudden heat, and without malice 
aforethought. The Attorney for the commonwealth waived the 
prosecution for murder, but quoted <i>British authorities</i> to show 
that she might be convicted of manslaughter, though committed for 
murder. The counsel for the accused arose, and in the most solemn 
manner, asked the court if it was a thing ever heard of, that an 
individual accused of one crime and acquitted, should be arraigned 
immediately for another, under the same prosecution? At 
intervals&mdash;boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom went the <i>British cannon</i>&mdash;<i>British 
authorities!</i> exclaimed the counsel; <i>British authorities</i>, 
gentlemen!! Is there any one upon that bench so dead to the feelings 
of patriotism as at such a moment to listen to <i>British 
authorities</i>, when the British cannon is shaking the very walls of 
your court house to their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"><small><small>[p. 304]</small></small></a></span>
foundation? This appeal was too 
cogent to be resisted. Up jumped one of the Justices and protested 
that it was not to be borne; let the prisoner go; away with your 
British authorities! The counsel for the accused, rubbed his hands 
and winked at the attorney; the attorney stood aghast; his 
astonishment was too great for utterance, and the negro was half way 
home before he recovered from his amazement.</p>

<h4>THE DEATH OF ROBESPIERRE.</h4>
<br>
<h5>SCENE I.</h5>
<center><small>ROBESPIERRE'S HOUSE.<br>
<br>
<i>Robespierre and St. Just meeting.</i></small></center>

<p><i>St. Just.</i>&mdash;Danton is gone!</p>

<p><i>Robespierre.</i>&mdash;Then can I hope for all things,<br>
  Since he is dead whose shadow darken'd me;<br>
  Did the crowd cheer or hiss him?</p>

<p><i>St. Just.</i>&mdash;Neither, sir:<br>
  Save a few voices, all look'd on in silence.</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;Ha! did they so?&mdash;but when the engine rattled,<br>
  And the axe fell, didst thou perceive him shudder?</p>

<p><i>St. Just.</i>&mdash;He turn'd his face to the descending steel,<br>
  And calmly smil'd. A low and ominous murmur<br>
  Spread through the vast assemblage&mdash;then, in peace,<br>
  They all dispers'd.</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;I did not wish for this.</p>

<p><i>St. Just.</i>&mdash;No man, since Louis Capet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;Say no more<br>
  My worthy friend&mdash;the friend of France and freedom&mdash;<br>
  Hasten to guard our interest in yon junto<br>
  Of fools and traitors, who, like timid sheep,<br>
  Nor fight nor fly, but huddle close together,<br>
  Till the wolves come to gorge themselves among them&mdash;<br>
  And in the evening, you and all my friends<br>
  Will meet me here, deliberate, and decide<br>
  To advance, or to recede. Be still, we cannot;<br>
  And hear me, dear St. Just&mdash;A man like you,<br>
  Firm and unflinching through so many trials,<br>
  Who sooner would behold this land manured<br>
  With carcases and moistened with their blood,<br>
  Than yielding food for feudal slaves to eat,<br>
  True to your party and to me your <i>brother</i>&mdash;<br>
  For so I would be term'd&mdash;has the best claim<br>
  That man can have to name his own reward<br>
  When France is all our own. Bethink you then<br>
  What post of honor or of profit suits you,<br>
  And tell me early, that I may provide,<br>
  To meet your views, a part in this great drama.</p>

<p><i>St. Just.</i>&mdash;Citizen Robespierre&mdash;my hearty thanks;<br>
  Financial Minister, by any name<br>
  Or trumpery title that may suit these times,<br>
  Is what I aim at&mdash;gratify me there<br>
  And I am yours through more blood than would serve<br>
  To float the L'Orient.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> A French line of battle ship. Burnt at the battle of 
Aboukir.</small></blockquote>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;'Tis well, St. Just,<br>
  But wherefore citizen me? I have not used<br>
  The term to you&mdash;we are not strangers here.</p>

<p><i>St. Just.</i>&mdash;Pardon me, sir, (or <i>Sire</i>, even as you please)<br>
  The cant of Jacobins infects my tongue,<br>
  I had no meaning farther. One word more<br>
  Before we part&mdash;now Danton is cut off,<br>
  We may be sure that all his partisans<br>
  And personal friends are our most deadly foes,<br>
  And it were politic and kind in us<br>
  To spare their brains unnumbered schemes of vengeance<br>
  And seize at once the power to silence them.<br>
  To give them time were ruin; some there are<br>
  Whose love of gold is such that were it wet<br>
  With Danton's blood they would not less receive it.<br>
  These may be brib'd to league with us. Farewell.</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i> (<i>solus</i>.) Blood on its base&mdash;upon its every step&mdash;<br>
  Yea, on its very summit&mdash;still I climb:<br>
  But thickest darkness veils my destiny,<br>
  And standing as I do on a frail crag<br>
  Whence I must make one desperate spring to power,<br>
  To safety, honor, and unbounded wealth,<br>
  Or be as Danton is, why do I pause?<br>
  Why do I gaze back on my past career,<br>
  Upon those piles of headless, reeking dead?<br>
  Those whitening sculls? those streams of guiltless blood<br>
  Still smoking to the skies?&mdash;why think I hear<br>
  The shrieks, the groans, the smothered execrations<br>
  That swell the breeze, or seem as if I shrank<br>
  Beneath the o'ergrown, yet still accumulating,<br>
  Curse of humanity that clings around me?<br>
  Is not my hate of them as fixed, intense,<br>
  And all unquenchable as theirs of me?<br>
  But they must tremble in their rage while I<br>
  Destroy and scorn them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><i>Daughter.</i>&mdash;Oh, say not so.<br>
  He is too peaceful for intrigues or plotters&mdash;<br>
  Too old, too helpless for their trust or aid.<br>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;If he were living<br>

  Of bigot slaves who tremble at a devil,<br>

  Will gravely <small>VOTE</small> their Maker from his throne,<br>

  The cheeks of men shall pale as they behold<br>
  The lurid sky it sinks in. Should I fall<br>
  Leading my Helots on to slay each other,<br>

  The secret fire that rages in my breast;<br>

<h5>SCENE IV.</h5>
<center><small>THE HALL OF THE NATIONAL CONVENTION.</small></center>

<p><small><i>Couthon concluding a speech from the Tribune. Tallien, Fouché, 
Carnôt, and others, standing near him. Robespierre, St. Just, and 
others, in their seats.</i></small></p>

<p><i>Tallien</i> (<i>to Fouché</i>.)&mdash;Are you ready?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"><small><small>[p. 307]</small></small></a></span>
<p><i>Fouché.</i>&mdash;Doubt not my aid&mdash;denounce him where he stands&mdash;<br>
  And lose no time&mdash;this hour decides our fate.</p>

<p><i>Couthon</i> (<i>to the Convention</i>.)&mdash;Our country is in danger&mdash;I invoke<br>
  Your aid, compatriots, to shield her now!<br>
  Fain as I am to avoid confiding power<br>
  Without control, in even patriot hands,<br>
  We cannot choose&mdash;and much as I abhor<br>
  To see blood flow, let punishment descend<br>
  On traitors' heads, for this alone can save us.</p>

<p><i>Tallien</i> (<i>approaching him</i>.) Thou aged fangless tiger! not yet glutted?<br>
  Torrents of blood are shed for thee and thine&mdash;<br>
  Must thou have more? Descend&mdash;before I trample<br>
  Thee to the earth. Thou art not fit to live.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>he drags Couthon down by the hair of his head and mounts the Tribune</i>.)<br>
  (<i>addressing the Convention</i>.) Yes, citizens, our country is imperiled,<br>
  And by a band of dark conspirators,<br>
  Soul-hardened miscreants, in whose grasp the ties<br>
  That bind mankind together are rent asunder<br>
  By spies&mdash;by fraud&mdash;by hope of power and spoils&mdash;<br>
  By baser fears, and by increasing terror<br>
  Of their dread engine, whose incessant strokes<br>
  And never failing stream astound mankind.<br>
  These men have pav'd the way, that open force<br>
  May crush the hopes of France, and bend our necks<br>
  Unto a despotism strange as bloody.<br>
  And who, my countrymen, hath been their leader?<br>
  Ye know him well&mdash;and every Frenchman breathing<br>
  Hath need to rue the hour which gave <i>him</i> birth&mdash;<br>
  A wretch accursed in heaven&mdash;abhorred on earth,<br>
  Hath dared aspire to sway most absolute<br>
  In this Republic&mdash;and the dread tribunals<br>
  Which for the land's protection were established<br>
  When pressed by foreign arms and homebred treason,<br>
  He hath converted to the deadly end<br>
  Of slaughtering all who crossed his onward path.<br>
  His black intrigues have occupied their seats<br>
  With robbers and assassins&mdash;whose foul riot,<br>
  Polluted lives, and unquenched thirst of gold,<br>
  Have beggar'd France and murdered half her sons.<br>
  Witness those long&mdash;long lists of dire proscription<br>
  Prepar'd at night for every coming day,<br>
  Even in the very chamber of the tyrant!<br>
  Witness the wanton, groundless confiscations,<br>
  Which ruin helpless men, to feed his minions!<br>
  Witness the cry of woe too great to bear,<br>
  That hath gone up to heaven from this fair land!<br>
  Yes&mdash;hear it, every man who loves his country&mdash;<br>
  France, for a ruler now, is ask'd to choose<br>
  The vampire who would drain her dearest blood:<br>
  A sordid slave, whose hideous form contains<br>
  A mind in moral darkness and fierce passions<br>
  Like nothing, save the cavern gloom of hell,<br>
  Which knows no light but its consuming fires!<br>
  I need not point to him. Your looks of terror,<br>
  Disgust and hatred turn at once upon him.<br>
  Though there be others of his name, this Hall&mdash;<br>
  This City&mdash;France&mdash;the World itself contains<br>

<p><i>Tallien</i> (<i>continuing</i>.) The evil spirit who serv'd abandons him,<br>
  And I denounce him as the mortal foe<br>
  Of every man in France who would be free&mdash;<br>
  Impeach him as a traitor to the State<br>
  In league with Henriot, Couthon and St. Just.<br>
  To overawe by force and crush the Assembly!<br>
  I appeal for proof to those who plotted with him,<br>
  But now repentant have abjur'd his cause.<br>
  I move that he be instantly arrested<br>
  With Henriot and all accomplices.</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i> (<i>to St. Just</i>.) See how they rise like fiends and point the hand<br>
  Of bitterest hatred at your head and mine,<br>
  Our veriest bloodhounds turn and strive to rend us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>he rushes towards the Tribune, amid 
loud cries of "Down with the tyrant!"</i>)</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;Hear me, ye members of the Mountain&mdash;hear me,<br>

  Thy Maker's name to sanctify thy crimes,<br>
  Thou lover of Religion! Saintly being!<br>

  To thy high priest. The scaffold is thy temple&mdash;<br>
  The block thy altar&mdash;murder is thy God.<br>

  Was it for this that Louis Capet died?<br>
  For this was it we swore eternal hatred<br>
  To kings and nobles&mdash;pour'd our armies forth&mdash;<br>
  Crush'd banded despots and confirmed our rights?<br>
  And have we bled, endur'd and toil'd, that now<br>

  And bend in worship to a man whose deeds<br>
  Have written demon on his very brow?<br>
  What! style Dictator&mdash;clothe with regal honors<br>
  And more than regal power this Robespierre,<br>
  So steep'd in guilt&mdash;so bath'd in human blood!<br>
  It may not be&mdash;France is at last awake<br>
  From this long dreary dream of shame and sorrow,<br>
  And may her sons in renovated strength<br>
  Shake off the lethargy that drew it on!<br>
  Spirits of Earth's <i>true</i> heroes!&mdash;if ye see us<br>
  From the calm sunshine of your blest abodes,<br>
  Look with approval on me in this hour!<br>

  Thee, I invoke!&mdash;Shade of the virtuous Brutus!<br>
  Like thee, I swear, should man refuse me justice<br>
  I draw this poignard for the tyrant's heart<br>
  Or for my own. Tallien disdains to live<br>
  The slave of Robespierre. I do not ask<br>
  Nor can expect him to receive the meed<br>
  Which should be his. Death cannot punish him<br>
  Whose life hath well deserv'd a thousand deaths,<br>
  But let us purge this plague-spot from among us,<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"><small><small>[p. 308]</small></small></a></span>
  And tell wide Europe by our vote this night<br>
  That Terror's reign hath ceas'd&mdash;that axe and sceptre<br>
  Are both alike disown'd, destroyed forever.<br>
  Let us impeach him, Frenchmen, with the spirit<br>
  That springs from conscious rectitude of purpose.<br>
  Patriots arise! and with uplifted hands<br>
  Attest your deep abhorrence of this man,<br>
  And your consent that he be now arrested!<br>
  (<i>members rising in disorder</i>.) Away, away with him&mdash;arrest him guards!<br>
  To the Conciergerie&mdash;away with him!</p>

<p>(<i>President rising.</i>) The National Convention have decreed<br>
  The arrest of Maximilien Robespierre.</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i> (<i>to St. Just</i>.) The day is theirs&mdash;with wrath and with despair<br>
  My utterance is chok'd. Oh, were my breath<br>
  A pestilential gale to sting their lives!<br>
  (<i>to the President</i>.) Order me to be slain where now I stand,<br>
  Or grant me liberty of speech.</p>

<p>(<i>President</i>.) Thy name is Robespierre&mdash;it is enough,<br>
  And speaks for thee far more than thou wilt tell us.</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i> (<i>to St. Just</i>.) Come thou with me&mdash;I see an opening yet<br>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> It may be well to recall to the reader's recollection, 
that Robespierre subsequently escaped from his guards to the Hotel 
de Ville. But such partisans as rallied around him speedily 
deserted, when a proclamation of outlawry from the Convention was 
issued against him, and enforced by pointing cannon against the 
building. After an ineffectual attempt at suicide he was conveyed in 
a cart to the guillotine, July 28th, 1794.</small></blockquote>

inconsistent with historical probability, as he had wounded himself 
with a pistol ball in the lower part of his face.</small></blockquote>

  I am content&mdash;I mean I am resigned&mdash;<br>
  As well die now as later. Does your wound<br>
  Pain you severely that you look so gravely?<br>
  Cheer thee, my comrade, we shall quickly learn<br>
  The last dread secret of our frail existence,<br>
  Few moments more will cut our barks adrift<br>
  Upon an ocean, boundless and unknown,<br>
  Even to ourselves who have despatched so many<br>
  To explore for us its dark and fathomless depths.<br>
  Give me some wine. (<i>they give him wine</i>.) Here's to a merry voyage!<br>
  What in the fiend's name art thou musing on!</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;My thoughts were with the past&mdash;the days of youth,<br>
  And peace, and innocence, and woman's love,<br>
  And ardent hope&mdash;the blossoms of a life<br>
  So baleful in its fruits. This day, the last<br>
  Of my career, is the anniversary<br>
  Of one, from which my after life may date<br>
  Its withering influence. Wouldst thou not think<br>
  That I, whom thou hast known for a few years,<br>
  Must ever have been, even from my earliest youth,<br>
  A hard and cruel man?</p>

<p><i>St. Just.</i>&mdash;Much like myself.<br>
  I think you were no saint even when a child.</p>

<p><i>Robes.</i>&mdash;Such is the common blunder of the world<br>
  To think me, like the demon they believe in,<br>
  From the beginning, "murderer and liar;"<br>
  So let it be&mdash;I would not change their thoughts.<br>
  But I, St. Just, strange as it seems to you,<br>
  Even I, whose name, even in this age of crime,<br>
  Must stand aloft alone a blood-red beacon<br>
  And warning to posterity, was once<br>
  Young, warm, enthusiastic, generous,<br>
  Candid, affectionate, a son and brother,<br>
  But proud and sensitive. I lov'd a maid&mdash;<br>
  Yes, if entire and all-absorbed devotion<br>
  Of life and soul and being to her, were love&mdash;<br>
  If to be willing to lay down my life,<br>
  My hopes of fame and honorable notice,<br>
  And all the world holds dear, for her dear sake,<br>
  May be call'd love, then I most truly lov'd her.<br>
  I was a thriving lawyer, and could raise<br>
  My voice without reward to shield the oppress'd,<br>
  I lov'd my kind and bore a stainless name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Of a man's life even to its source, to poison!<br>
  A trifle scarcely worthy of a name,<br>
  The sarcasms of a brute, while I was pleading<br>
  An orphan's cause, convulsed the court with mirth,<br>
  Marr'd all my rhetoric, and snatch'd the palm<br>
  Of truth and justice from my eager grasp&mdash;<br>
  My wrath boil'd forth&mdash;with loud and fierce reproach<br>
  I brav'd the judge, and thunder'd imprecations<br>
  On all around. This passion ruin'd me.<br>

  Oh, tell not me of jealousy or hate<br>
  Or hunger for revenge&mdash;no sting so fierce,<br>
  So all tormenting to a proud man's soul<br>

  Could plague it with a sword. Had yonder cowards<br>

  If that my name and deeds be not a fable.<br>
  I die&mdash;and, Frenchmen, triumph while you may!<br>
  The man breathes now and walks abroad among ye,<br>
  Who shall be my successor. I can see<br>
  Beyond the tomb&mdash;and when ye dare to rise<br>
  And beard the tyrant faction, now victorious,<br>
  His rule commences. He shall spill more blood<br>
  In one short day to crush your hopes of freedom,<br>
  Than I in half my reign&mdash;but God himself<br>
  Ne'er had the homage ye shall render <i>him</i>.<br>
  Champions of freedom, ye shall <i>worship</i> him,<br>
  And in the name of liberty be plunder'd<br>
  Of all for which your sons have fought and died;<br>
  And in the name of glory he shall lead ye<br>
  On to perdition, and when ye have plac'd<br>
  Your necks beneath his feet, shall spend like dust<br>
  Your treasures and pour forth your bravest blood<br>
  To be the scourge of nations and of kings.<br>
  And he shall plant your eagles in the west,<br>
  And spread your triumphs even to northern snow,<br>
  Tormenting man and trampling every law,<br>
  Divine and human, till the very name<br>
  Of Frenchmen move to nought but hate and scorn.<br>
  Then heaven with storms, and earth with all her armies<br>
  Shall rise against ye, and the o'erwhelming tide<br>
  Of your vast conquests ebb in shame and ruin.<br>
  Then&mdash;false to honor, native land, and chief!&mdash;<br>
  Ye who could swarm like locusts on the earth<br>
  For glory or for plunder, shall desert,<br>
  Or Judas-like betray, the cause of freedom,<br>
  And tamely crouch to your now banish'd king,<br>
  When foreign swords instale him in his throne:<br>
  And laugh and sing while Prussians and Cossacks<br>
  Parade the streets of this vice-branded city,<br>
  And see without a blush the Austrian flag<br>
  And England's banner float o'er Notre Dame.</p>

<p>Bye-word among the nations! Fickle France!<br>
  Distant and doubtful is your day of freedom,<br>
  If ever it shall dawn, which it ne'er will,<br>
  Until ye learn, what my hate would not teach ye.<br>
  On, to the scaffold! May my blood infect<br>
  With its fierce mania every human heart&mdash;<br>
  Mourn'd as I am by none! May ye soon prove<br>
  Another ruler o'er this land like me.</p>

<h4>WOMAN.</h4>
<br>

<p>To woman is assigned the second grade in the order of created 
beings. Man occupies the first, and to him she looks for earthly 
support, protection, and a "present help" in time of need. The 
stations which they occupy&mdash;the pursuits which they should engage 
in&mdash;the legitimate aim to which their thoughts and wishes should 
tend, are widely different, yet inseparably connected. To show the 
error so prevalent in respect to these subjects, the improper mode 
of education so generally adopted, and if possible, to assign to 
woman her proper sphere, privileges and pursuits, is the object of 
the present sketch. We have stated that woman is second <i>only</i> in 
the scale of created beings, and proceed to examine, first, the 
important station which she occupies&mdash;secondly, the means usually 
adopted for preparing her for this station&mdash;thirdly, the results 
produced by those means&mdash;fourthly, the proper means&mdash;and lastly, 
endeavor to illustrate the ideas advanced by the testimony of 
history, and the observations drawn from real life.</p>

<p>1st. The important stations which she occupies. A daughter, a 
sister&mdash;the friend and companion of both sexes and all ages&mdash;the 
wife, the mistress, the mother&mdash;stations high, honorable, important.</p>

<p>In the second place, we will examine the means usually adopted for 
preparing her for these elevated and important duties. View her 
first the helpless infant&mdash;her heart uncorrupted by external 
influences, and her mind, like the unsullied mirror, to be made the 
reflector of those images and lessons, to which it is to be 
subjected and exposed. Soon, however, the innocence of the infant 
gives way to the frowardness and turbulence of the child. Generally, 
no restraints of a salutary nature have been exercised over her 
mind. The hacknied axiom, that "she is too young to understand," has 
prevented any examination into her powers of perception or 
reflection, and she has been left to follow 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"><small><small>[p. 310]</small></small></a></span> 
the desires of her 
own heart. The petulance of a nurse, impatience or thoughtlessness 
of a mother, may have frequently thwarted her little plans, or 
denied her some indulgence. Her feelings were most frequently soured 
by these restraints, ill humor or obstinacy was the usual 
result&mdash;both either suffered to pass by unnoticed, or treated in a 
manner calculated to engender feelings and passions, which in future 
life are destined to exercise a powerful and painful influence over 
her own happiness and that of others. Soon the child exchanges the 
nursery for the school room. If her circumstances in life are 
prosperous and <i>refined</i>, humorous studies and indiscriminately 
selected accomplishments are forced upon her mind, or crowded upon 
her hands; the former, impaired by early neglect, and enervated by 
improper indulgences, is wholly incompetent to the task assigned it. 
A superficial knowledge of many things is the usual result, while 
her vanity, long fed by the praises of menials and imprudent 
commendations of friends, visitors, &amp;c. steps in and whispers to her 
credulous ear, that she <i>is</i>, or <i>will</i> be, all that woman <i>can</i> or 
<i>ought</i> to be. During these school-day exercises, her mind has 
frequently been edified by relations of future scenes of pleasure in 
ball-rooms, theatres, assemblies, &amp;c.&mdash;that she may shine in them 
being the object of her present course of study; while tales of 
rivalry, conquest, hatred and revenge, are frequently related in her 
presence, or placed in her hands; things which, if not really 
praiseworthy in themselves, are related and heard with an <i>eclat</i>, 
that induces the belief that they are the inevitable attendants on 
fashionable pleasures and high life. If a stimulant is applied to 
urge her on to diligence, it is to excel some companion, or some 
other like inducement, which must inevitably foster feelings of envy 
or emulation, calculated to poison the fountain from which is to 
flow the future stream of life. Such is a fashionable or popular 
education. The next stage on which we behold her, is the broad 
theatre of gay life. The duties of the daughter and sister she was 
never taught, and is now acting under her third station&mdash;that of the 
companion and friend of both sexes and most ages. If possessed of 
personal attractions, she moves about&mdash;the little magnet of her 
circle. Meeting with no events to arouse evil passions, she contents 
herself with exercising a petty tyranny over the hearts of the 
admiring swains, who follow, bow to, and flatter her. After a few 
brief months or years of pleasure, she determines to marry; and at 
length selects from her <i>train</i> the wealthiest, handsomest, or most 
admired of her suitors. Her heart has no part in this transaction. 
Ignorant of the nature of love&mdash;ignorant of the principles necessary 
to ensure happiness in the married state, she remains ignorant of 
the exalting, ennobling influence, which it exercises over minds 
capable of appreciating or enjoying its blessings. She is now the 
wife&mdash;the mistress&mdash;the mother. Thus are rapidly crowded on her 
duties, for which she was never prepared by education, and which she 
is consequently incompetent to perform. Perhaps, for a season, the 
current of her life runs smooth. Her husband&mdash;either blindly devoted 
to her, or bent on the gratification of his own pleasures&mdash;allows 
her unrestrained to mingle in the same pleasures and gay scenes in 
which he found her. She is still seemingly amiable, and perhaps 
considered quite a notable woman by the most of her companions.</p>

<p>But a change comes! the sun of prosperity withdraws his rays. She is 
now forced to abandon that, which has hitherto formed all her 
happiness. Need I describe the result. Her heart, unaccustomed to 
disappointments or restraints, unfortified by holy principles, 
unsustained by mental resources, and perhaps too little influenced 
by conjugal devotion or maternal tenderness, either frets away the 
smile of peace and rose of health; or, sunk in self-consuming 
mortification, envy or some unholy passion, abandons itself to the 
darkness of despair, the rust of inactivity, or the canker of 
discontent. Her husband, if his pride and principles have survived 
his ruined prospects, may struggle for a time to keep up the dignity 
of a man; but his heart is chilled, his exertions are 
paralyzed&mdash;domestic happiness he cannot find, and too frequently he 
is driven abroad in search of those comforts and that peace, which 
can be found at home alone.</p>

<p>This is no ideal picture&mdash;it is only one of the thousands which may 
be found in real life. If we leave our own land and direct our 
attention to those countries where women hold the reins of state, we 
will only see the principles of early education more powerfully 
displayed. Among savage nations (and what but want of early culture 
makes a savage?) see the horrid Zingha, queen of Matamba and Angola. 
Nursed in scenes of carnage and blood, what could she be but a 
monster, the existence of whom would fain be believed to have sprung 
but in the heated imagination of a dream? In a more civilized 
country, behold Christina of Sweden. She was reared by her father to 
be any thing but a useful woman. She knew no restraint when young, 
and when she ascended the throne, knew no law but her own will&mdash;and 
what was the result? Despised at home, and finding that even on a 
throne she must in self-defence yield some of her feelings to 
demands of others, rather than do so she abdicated it, and leaving 
her native land, roamed among other nations, a reproach to her sex 
and a general object of disgust. Look at Mary, Queen of England. Her 
first lessons were malice and revenge, and faithfully did she 
practise them when exalted to power. And we may name the beautiful 
Anne Boleyn. Ambition was the goal to which all her early energies 
were directed, and to ambition she sacrificed honor, humanity, and 
eventually her life. In more modern times, the lovely lady Mary W. 
Montague may be noticed. Endowed with talents, accomplishments, 
beauty, rank, fortune, she seemed formed to move a bright and 
favored star in the world's horizon. But no early discipline had 
prepared her to be happy. United to a man who idolized her, and whom 
she loved&mdash;what but the want of self-control and submission to the 
will of others, caused her separation from a husband every way 
worthy of her? But why enumerate other cases? These are but a few, 
taken from among thousands of both modern and ancient times.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, we proceed to point out the remedy for these 
evils, by briefly shewing some of the proper plans to be adopted in 
education. We again assert, that in the nursery are first sown the 
seeds of future character. Where is the prudent and observing 
parent, that will not acknowledge, that at a very early age the 
infant is capable of forming good or bad habits, and of 
discriminating between the approbation or 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"><small><small>[p. 311]</small></small></a></span> displeasure shown 
towards it. None, we presume, will gainsay this point. As soon then 
as this intelligence on the part of a child is discovered, so soon 
does a parent's duties begin, and if faithfully discharged, the task 
of rearing up a useful and ornamental member of society, will be 
found comparatively easy.</p>

<p>If taught then to yield its desires to parental wishes and 
commands&mdash;taught that the path of duty is the path of 
pleasure&mdash;convinced by every day's experience that the object of all 
restraints is her good, and proving continually that her happiness 
is her parent's great delight, she soon becomes, both by habit and 
nature, submissive,&mdash;and consequently is at peace with herself and 
all around her. If a sister, early does she learn, that affection 
and tenderness to those so closely united to her, is a duty, the 
performance of which, brings a sweet reward. Gradually are her 
duties enlarging, and gradually is she prepared by judicious 
government and good habits, to fulfil them.</p>

<p>When the nursery is exchanged for the school room, easy is the task 
to lead that child on from knowledge to knowledge. The mind is not 
crowded with many and incongruous studies&mdash;but gradually is it 
enlarged, and its wants supplied by a well regulated course. If in a 
situation to permit the acquirement of ornamental branches, she is 
taught to regard them as the light dressings of the mind, intended 
not to interfere with what is useful and solid, but as a recreation 
and source of future pleasure to herself and friends. When the 
mental powers are sufficiently expanded, to digest what is presented 
to them, books of general knowledge and taste are allowed, while the 
manners have been formed by good society, and the ideas arranged by 
conversation, &amp;c. If intended to mingle in a gay circle for a 
season, her character is so formed as to be able to resist, in a 
great degree, the snares to which such scenes usually expose the 
young and thoughtless. Taught to regard these things as trifles 
compared to the other pursuits of life, she enjoys without abusing 
them, and willingly returns to the sweet domestic fireside, and the 
pleasures and amusements within her own bosom.</p>

<p>The feelings which will exist between that daughter and her parents, 
deserve to be considered. The filial care and tenderness which was 
exercised over her mind, will not be forgotten or unrepaid. In all 
times of doubt or difficulty, to a parent's bosom and counsel will 
she fly, as her surest refuge. If about to settle in life, prudence 
and the heart directs her choice. To her parents she confides the 
feelings and hopes that agitate her bosom. On their judgment she 
relies, and knowing their sentiments are governed by the desire to 
see her happy, she is prepared to weigh all their reasons, and to 
act with prudence. She was early taught to reflect, and is now 
capable of acting, with dignity. Her heart is capable of <i>love</i>&mdash;she 
has been taught the nature of the flame, and the only solid grounds 
on which it could be reared. She is capable of discriminating 
between a man of <i>ton</i> and a man of worth. Most generally, such a 
woman will marry well. The man of lightness, dissipation and folly, 
rarely seeks her hand. He may and does admire her, but he feels his 
own inferiority, and rarely wishes to form such an alliance.</p>

<p>The man of sense, of virtue, and of solidity, would seek such a 
companion to share his pleasure and sooth his pain. Mutual 
sympathies would engender mutual esteem, and on that foundation it 
is easy, very easy to rear the altar of love. A union formed with 
such feelings would most generally prove a happy one. If prosperous, 
such a woman is qualified to use without abusing her blessings. The 
lessons learnt at her first <i>home</i> would be practised in her second, 
and she would be likely to discharge with credit the duties of a 
wife, a mother, and a mistress. If misfortunes came, she would be 
prepared to brave the storm. Her affections, never set on earthly 
pleasures and splendid scenes, would relinquish them without grief. 
Her mind, stored with useful and ornamental information, would 
furnish a treasury from whence her family and herself could draw 
with profit and delight. In the humblest vale of poverty, such a 
woman would be a blessing to her whole circle of associates, and in 
most cases preserve the affection of her husband and raise a family, 
respectable and useful. This too is no ideal picture. Such women 
have been found in all ages, and such women may be raised up in 
almost every circle of society. If denied the extended advantage 
meant by a liberal or elegant education, the principles here laid 
down may be carried to the peasant's cottage, as well as to the 
splended domes of the rich and great. Among the biographies of women 
in all civilized nations, many beautiful examples might be adduced.</p>

<p>Among the wives and mothers of our own land a rich collection might 
be found. One thing is here worthy of record. In tracing the history 
of nearly all the great men, with whose history we are acquainted, 
whether remarkable for valor, piety, or any other noble attribute, 
to a mother's influence is their eminence to be attributed, in a 
greater or less degree. But it is needless to enumerate instances on 
this occasion, as our sketch is already extended beyond the intended 
limits. Should it give rise to inquiry and serious investigation on 
this important subject, or furnish a hint worthy the attention of 
the serious and anxious parent, the utmost ambition of the author 
will be realized.</p>

<h4>READINGS WITH MY PENCIL.</h4>

<center>NO. III.<br>
<br>
<small>Legere sine calamo est dormire.&mdash;<i>Quintilian</i>.</small></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><small>21. "There is a pride, in being left behind, to find resources 
within, which others seek without."&mdash;<i>Washington Irving</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>I have pondered a good deal on this passage, and find a beautiful 
moral in what, when I first read it, I was fain to fancy but a 
misanthropic, or, at the least, an unsocial sentiment. I now feel 
and acknowledge its truth. "There <i>is</i> a pride in being left behind, 
to find resources within, which others seek without." What concern 
have I in the greater brightness that another's name is shedding? 
Let them shine on whose honor is greater. Their orbit cannot 
interfere with mine. There may be something very grand and sublime 
in the wide sweep of Herschel and Saturn: but planets, whose path is 
smaller, are more cheered by the rays of light and warmth from the 
sun, which is the centre of their revolutions.</p>

<blockquote><small>22. "Oh the hopeless misery of March in America. Poetry, taste, 
fancy, feeling,&mdash;all are chilled by that ever-snowing sky, that ever 
snow clad earth. Man were happy could he be a mole for the nonce, 
and so sleep out this death-in-life, an American six months' 
winter."&mdash;<i>Subaltern in America</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>What a querulous noodle! He is one of those who can "travel from Dan 
to Beersheba, and cry, All is barren!" It is March, and "March in 
America," while I write. The air is bracing and full of reviving 
springlike influences. I disagree with the would-be mole from whom I 
quote. I love to watch every month's sweep of the sun,&mdash;while he is 
performing his low wintry arc, as if almost ashamed to revolve 
around the cheerless earth, and while he daily performs a wider and 
wider circle, until at length he comes to stand nearly over my head 
at noon. I enjoy the result the more intensely for watching its 
progress. I love to watch him gradually calling out the green on the 
black hills around me, whose only beauty now are the narrow stripes 
of fading snow, forming white borders that intersect each other, 
thus dividing the mould into something not altogether void of the 
picturesque. So, on yonder field, where the sun now shines quite 
cheeringly, there is a remnant of beauty. The dead grass, with its 
yellow and reddish tinge, is divided by small crystal ponds and 
canals, glistening in the bright ray, and seeming like the gratitude 
of the poor,&mdash;able to return but little, yet determined to return 
that little gladly.</p>

<blockquote><small>23. "There is no motion so graceful as that of a beautiful girl in 
the mazy meanderings of the dance. Nature cannot furnish a more 
perfect illustration of the poetry of motion than this."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></small></blockquote>

<p>Yes she can. I will give the traveller two far more perfect 
illustrations. The <i>on deggiando</i> movement of a light breeze, as it 
passes, wave upon wave, over high grass: and the gradual and rapid 
passing away of a shadow, when the sun leaves a cloud, from a hill 
side of rich foliage.</p>

<blockquote><small>24. "I have been thinking, more and more, of the probability of 
departed friends' watching over those whom they have left 
behind."&mdash;<i>Henry Kirk White</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>I have often done so; and whether the idea be a delusive one or not, 
there is no delusion in believing that the Deity sees them and us at 
the same instant. They turn, and we turn, at the same moment, to 
him, and thus through him we enjoy a communion. If two hearts were 
once preserved in reciprocal love by contemplating, when parted from 
each other, the same star, how close will be the bond with those who 
have gone before us, when, at such a distance, we are worshipping 
the same God!</p>

<blockquote><small>25. "<i>When one is angry, and edits a paper</i>, I should think the 
temptation too strong for literary, <i>which is not always human 
nature</i>."&mdash;<i>Lord Byron</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>There is a couple of young Irishmen who "edit a paper" not far from 
the place of this present writing, who might furnish a striking 
corroboration of this opinion of the noble poet. Think of a couple 
of boobies, pretending to be oracles in literature, wreaking their 
petty vengeance upon the productions of one against whom they have a 
personal pique! Such and so contemptible are some of the "critics!" 
God save the mark! of this generation!</p>

<p>"Let us hurry to the walls"&mdash;said Abel-Shittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi, and 
Simeon the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the 
year of the world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one&mdash;"let us 
hasten to the ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in 
the city of David, and overlooking the camp of the 
uncircumcised&mdash;for it is the last hour of the fourth watch, being 
sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the promise of Pompey, 
should be awaiting us with the lambs for the sacrifices."</p>

<p>Simeon, Abel-Shittim, and Buzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or 
Sub-Collectors of the offering in the holy city of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"Verily"&mdash;replied the Pharisee&mdash;"let us hasten: for this generosity 
in the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an 
attribute of the worshippers of Baal."</p>

<p>"That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the 
Pentateuch"&mdash;said Buzi-Ben-Levi&mdash;"but that is only towards the 
people of Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved 
wanting to their own interest? Methinks it is no great stretch of 
generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in 
lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head!"</p>

<p>"Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi"&mdash;replied Abel-Shittim&mdash;"that 
the Roman Pompey, who is now impiously beseiging the City of the 
Most High, has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus 
purchased for the altar to the sustenance of the body, rather than 
of the spirit."</p>

<p>"Now by the five corners of my beard"&mdash;shouted the Pharisee, who 
belonged to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints 
whose manner of <i>dashing</i> and lacerating the feet against the 
pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees&mdash;a 
stumbling block to less gifted perambulators)&mdash;"by the five corners 
of that beard which as a priest I am forbidden to shave!&mdash;have we 
lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of 
Rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh 
the most holy and consecrated elements? Have we lived to see the day 
when"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us not question the motives of the Philistine"&mdash;interrupted 
Abel-Shittim&mdash;"for to-day we profit for the first time by his 
avarice or by his generosity. But rather let us hurry to the 
ramparts, lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire 
the rains of Heaven cannot extinguish&mdash;and whose pillars of smoke no 
tempest can turn aside."</p>

<p>That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and 
which bore the name of its architect King David, was esteemed the 
most strongly fortified district of Jerusalem&mdash;being situated upon 
the steep and lofty hill of Zion. Here a broad, deep, 
circumvallatory trench&mdash;hewn from the solid rock&mdash;was defended by a 
wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge. This wall was 
adorned, at regular interspaces, by square towers of white 
marble&mdash;the lowest sixty&mdash;the highest one hundred and twenty cubits 
in height. But in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin the wall 
arose by no means immediately from the margin of the fosse. On the 
contrary, between the level of the ditch and the basement of the 
rampart, sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty 
cubits&mdash;forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when 
Simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called 
Adoni-Bezek&mdash;the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem, 
and the usual place of conference with the beseiging army&mdash;they 
looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling, 
by many feet, that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by several, that 
of the Temple of Belus.</p>

<p>"Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!"&mdash;here shouted a 
Roman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from 
the regions of Pluto&mdash;"lower away the basket with that accursed coin 
which it has broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it 
thus you evince your gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his 
condescension, has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous 
importunities? The God Phœbus, who is a true God, has been 
charioted for an hour&mdash;and were you not to have been on the ramparts

world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of 
every kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I 
say&mdash;and see that your trumpery be bright in color, and just in weight!"</p>

<p>"El Elohim!"&mdash;ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of 
the centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted 
away against the Temple&mdash;"El Elohim!&mdash;<i>who</i> is the God 
Phœbus?&mdash;<i>whom</i> doth the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi!

<p>By the assistance of some rudely-constructed machinery, the 
heavily-laden basket was now lowered carefully down among the 
multitude&mdash;and, from the giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen 
crowding confusedly around it&mdash;but, owing to the vast height and the 
prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of their operations could be obtained.</p>

<p>"Booshoh he!&mdash;for shame!&mdash;it is a ram from the thickets of Engedi, 
and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!"</p>

<p>"It is a firstling of the flock," said Abel-Shittim&mdash;"I know him by 
the bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His 
eyes are more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral&mdash;and his 
flesh is like the honey of Hebron."</p>

Pharisee&mdash;"the Heathen have dealt wonderfully with us&mdash;let us raise

<p>The gentleman whose words I have just used, maintained on all 
occasions the superiority of modern over ancient literature. He 
prefers the better portions of Milman's "Samor, Lord of the Bright 
City," to the better portions of the Odyssey; and contends that 
"Scott's description of the battle of Flodden Hill, the midnight 
visit of William of Deloraine to Melrose Abbey, &amp;c., are unequalled 
by anything in the Iliad or Æneid."</p>

<p>Now such comparisons are plainly unreasonable. "To read Homer's 
poems, is to look upon a brightly colored nosegay whose odor is 
departed," or, if not departed, at least lost to our dull and 
ignorant sense. The subtle odor of idiom and provincial 
peculiarity&mdash;the stronger odor of association are entirely lost to 
us. I may better illustrate my idea. Every one will recollect the 
following couplet in the description of William of Deloraine:</p>

<p>Reversing the order of things, suppose these lines read by a Greek 
of twenty-seven centuries ago; suppose him even well acquainted with 
the English tongue&mdash;could he appreciate their beauty? Let the Greek 
attempt to <i>translate</i> the lines into his own language. He begins 
with <i>stark</i>. The nice excellence of this word he knows nothing of. 
He finds that its meaning is somewhere between <i>stout</i> and <i>swift</i>, 
and gives the Greek word "οχυς." The first downward step 
has been taken. He next pounces upon the term, <i>moss-troopers</i>. He 
translates this "Ληστης ιπποτʼ ανδρειο." <i>Couched</i>, is an 
idiom which he cannot translate; he gives us by way of equivalent, 
"εβαλλε." <i>Border lance</i>, is beyond his version. He 
contents himself with a simple "δορυ,"&mdash;for how is the word 
<i>Border</i> to be translated? It is a word depending on collateral 
matters for its meaning. These matters&mdash;involving the storied reyd 
and feud&mdash;must be known before the word can be understood; and 
twenty centuries would blot out all remembrance of the Percy and 
Douglas feuds. The word <i>Border</i> is therefore, wholly lost in the 
version.</p>

<p>If Scott would suffer so much in the eyes of the Greek and Latin 
reader, it is only fair to presume that Homer and Virgil suffer as 
much in our eyes.</p>

<p>We perceive the merits of our modern poet; we are blind to the 
merits of the ancient. We are consequently incapable of judging 
between them. Mr. Grimckè's comparison is unreasonable.</p>

<blockquote><small>"Humility is certainly beautiful, but vanity is not always 
uncomely."&mdash;<i>Anon.</i></small></blockquote>

<p>It is singular how little we appreciate the humility of some men. 
Launce says, "I am an ass," and we, coinciding with him in the 
sentiment, scarcely think of giving him credit for his humility. We 
perhaps take the trouble to approve of his want of vanity&mdash;but this 
is only a negative sort of approbation. Humility seems such a man's 
province&mdash;as natural to him as the grass to a snail. To be 
appreciated, humility must manifest itself in high natures. We are 
captivated by the spectacle of highness contenting itself with 
lowliness. The grass is natural to the snail, but the home of the 
lark is the sky&mdash;and when he descends to the meadow, we, mindful of 
his fleetness of pinion, marvel at his descent and love him for his 
simple humility. The "great Lyttleton" was a man of the most perfect 
modesty. A fine specimen of this may be found in the last paragraph 
of his work upon the English laws, "And know, my son, that I would 
not have thee believe, that all which I have said in these bookes is 
law, for I will not presume to take this upon me. But of those 
things which are not law, inquire and learn of my wise masters 
learned in the law." Sir John Mandeville, who wrote in the 
fourteenth century, was also remarkable for his modesty as a writer. 
I will quote a fine sample of it. "I, John Maundeville, knyghte 
aboveseyd (alle thoughe I be unworthi) have passed manye londes, and 
many yles and contrees, and cerched manye fulle straunge places, and 
have ben in manye a fulle gode honourable companye, and at manye a 
faire dede of armes&mdash;alle be it that I dide none myself, for myn 
unable insuffisance&mdash;etc."</p>

<p>V<small>ANITY</small> in a weak man is disgusting; all pretension is disgusting. 
But "vanity is not always uncomely." The vanity of a strong man is 
sometimes beautiful. I remember an instance or two of this beautiful 
vanity. Some lines of Spenser&mdash;a part, I believe, of the preface to 
his Dreams of Petrarch, occur to me.</p>

<blockquote><small>"Love, despair, ambition, and peace, spring up like trees from the 
soil of our natures."&mdash;<i>E. Irving</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>This idea, by a "singular coincidence," has been carried out in the 
Chinese novel, 'Yu-Kiao-Li, or the Adventures of Red Jasper and 
Dream of a Peartree,'&mdash;<i>traduit par M. Abel Remusat</i>. I translate 
from the French translation.</p>

<p>"In a fresh soil under a pleasant sky&mdash;clouded, but spanned by a 
rainbow&mdash;grew a green tree. Its branches were beautifully fashioned, 
and wore leaves which seemed to be chiselled from emerald. The 
moonlight fell upon the tree, and so intense was the reflection that 
every portion of the surrounding scenery took upon itself a gaudy 
and happy coloring. This tree was <i>Love</i>&mdash;it grew from the soil of a 
young nature. Alas! its life cannot be the life of the amaranth.</p>

<p>"The second tree was in a soil torn up and bruised&mdash;the plants of 
which were freezing under a cold wind. Its branches were matted and 
black. No light penetrated them. The sky above was of ebony. The 
rainbow was not there. This tree was <i>Despair</i>. Alas! for the beauty 
of Love! Is it not pushed from its stool by Despair?</p>

<p>"The third tree was in a soil firm to the eye, but undermined by the 
molewarp. Its scathed branches were entombed in the sky. Its peak, 
jealous of the eagle, out-towered him. About its stem, and through 
its haughty boughs a strange light played. It was neither the light 
of the sun nor yet the light of the moon. It was a false glare&mdash;a 
glare greatest about the region of decay. This tree was <i>Ambition</i>. 
Alas! for the pride and the haughty yearning of mortal men!</p>

<p>"In the healthy soil of a valley, on which the eye of a bright day 
seemed ever open, grew the fourth tree. Its branches neither towered 
haughtily nor stooped slavishly. Health was in every bough; and lo! 
the rainbow which had fallen from the sky of Despair had surely been 
imprisoned among its leaves. The wind fanned these leaves healthily 
and their transparent cups teinted by the sunlight&mdash;as red wines 
teint the fine vases of porcelain&mdash;were beautiful to behold. This 
tree was <i>Peace</i>. The moonlight of Love may grow dim; the sky of 
Despair is of ebony; the light of Ambition dies in the ashes of its 
fuel; but the sunlight of Peace is the light of an eye ever open. 
The head may be white and bowed down, but the threads of the 
angel-woven rainbow are wrapped about the heart of peaceful and holy Eld."</p>

<blockquote><small>"The chiefest constituent of human beauty is the hair; after which 
in degree is to be ranked the eye; and lastly come the color and the 
texture of the skin. The varieties of these, cause it to happen that 
not unfrequently men differ in opinion as to what is comely and what 
is uncomely; this man maintaining black to be the better color for 
the hair as for the eye; that man maintaining a lighter color to be 
the better for both."&mdash;<i>Burton</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Poets are generally persons of taste, and if we could find one of 
them certainly unbiassed by early recollections and the thousand 
trifles which warp taste, we might consider his judgment in regard 
to "the rival colors of the hair," as going far to exalt the color 
of his choice above its rivals. But the first of the modern 
philosophers loved squinting eyes because in his youth he had been 
in love with a little girl who squinted; and no taste is free from 
the influence of early recollections. Spenser's cousin, the lady who 
discarded him, "had hair of a flaxen hue." He ever after preferred 
this "hue," to all others. Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald was "of a 
stately person and gifted with pale glossy hair, with a sunny tinge 
about it." Lord Surrey sang of these "mixed ringlets" until the day 
of his death. I do not know that Ben. Jonson ever had a sweetheart, 
but he surely had a taste as good as if it had never been biassed by 
love for one. He speaks very well of&mdash;</p>

Neither auburn nor red, but "perfectly

some pretty verses upon a lock of this golden hair. He speaks of 
each thread as,

<center><small>&mdash;&mdash;"meandering in pellucid gold."</small></center>

<p>I forget the lines. This was the color beloved by a thousand poets; 
and one was found who forgot in contemplating the rare masses that, 
stained with it, lay upon the brow of Lucrecia Borgia, the "dark and 
unbridled passions" which led her to the bed of one brother and to 
the murder of another&mdash;and which have doomed her to "an immortality 
of evil repute."</p>

<p>Before ending this "scrap" I will quote some sentences written by a 
friend of my own long ago&mdash;a very eccentric man, and indeed a 
melancholy one. He had been crossed in love, and could rarely speak 
or write without recurring to the origin of his unhappiness. He had 
a great many faults, but he is dead now, and has been so for many 
years; I am not anxious to say any more about them. The paragraph 
which I copy from his manuscript, is a portion of a flighty book, 
the aim or meaning of which I could never discover. It owes its 
fanciful extravagance, I rather think, to the influence of opium 
upon the author's nerves. After pointing out the numerous 
particulars in which "nature imitates our women," he proceeds to 
observe after the following fashion,</p>

<blockquote><small>"In the hair, nature is most an imitator. The cascade caressing the 
precipice with the threads of its silver locks, which the teeth of 
the granite comb have frizled, and which the winds play at gambol 
with, is only a copy. So with the vine on the rock&mdash;the great vine 
whose metallic tendrils I have looked on and wondered at when the 
sunshine spanned them with a cloven halo. So with the drooping 
moss&mdash;the <i>Barba Espagna</i>, with its drapery of gold held by threads 
of spun alabaster, hanging in <i>hard</i> festoons from the tree beside 
the Lagoon and sighing when its hues die with the sunlight. And so 
with the boughs of our weeping trees. O, but are not these last most 
beautiful? Place your ear to the soft grass-blades on the brink of a 
valley brook, and listen to the monotone of the willow's stirred 
ringlets, and watch them as the wind lifts them from the eddy 
beneath to float, bejewelled by adhering globules. And then look 
upon them as with the abating wind they sink lower and lower, 
leaving their cool rain upon your cheek. See them trail in the 
pebbly waters and conjure up in each detached leaf an Elfin barque 
laden with its rare boatmen and tiny beauties. Hear the tinkle of 
the little bells and the shrieks of the wrecked mariners, as they 
cling to the hair of the willow (as Zal clung to the locks of his 
mistress) and splash the brook into foam. And now they leap to the 
backs of their skipper steeds, and ply the spur of the thistle seed, 
and gallop off for the green shore, wringing their hands and 
bewailing the ill fate of their holiday trim. Such marvellous 
fancies, if you are fanciful, will prick your brain until the drowsy 
sough of the tree-hair and the renewed trickle of the raining spray 
lend your eyes sleep and call forth the dream spirit, as the fly 
from its cocoon, and give it the wings of wilder vagary to flutter 
away withal&mdash;whither? <i>Mine</i> would return to my wanderings by Goluon 
with her whose tomb in the valley of sweet waters often pillows my 
head."</small></blockquote>

<p>Alas for my poor friend Bob! He died of a broken heart&mdash;that is to 
say <i>mediately</i>. He died <i>im</i>-mediately of hard drinking. Napoleon 
remembered the Seine on his death-bed and asked to be buried upon 
its sunniest bank; Bob remembered Goluon when his great temples had 
the death-damp upon them. His vision had failed him; his nose had 
become peaked; his body, like a jaded and worn hack, had fallen 
under the spirit, which like a stout horseman had long kept it to 
its paces; but the little abiding place of memory had not been 
destroyed, and poor Bob muttered at times of a dead lady with fair 
hair&mdash;of a valley of sweet waters&mdash;of a grave with two willows above 
it&mdash;of pleasant Goluon&mdash;and died with an unuttered prayer upon his 
lips, and with a strong desire at his heart. The prayer was, that I, 
his friend, would bury him between the two willows&mdash;on the evening 
bank of Goluon&mdash;side by side with Betty Manning his old sweetheart. 
Poor Bob! May God take kind care of his soul!</p>

<p>In the lines just quoted, the poet (old Philip Allen, a Welshman) 
strikes the proper key. When we have ceased to derive pleasure from 
that which once afforded it to us, we should regard the change as 
<i>in ourselves</i>. The grass of the hill is as green as it ever was, 
but the step once "light" has become "tame." The bird sings as 
sweetly as ever, but the "bright heart" into which the "honey drops 
of his constant song" once fell, has been dimmed and darkened by 
human passions. The berry-clusters are still in the fringe of the 
thicket, but the palate has no longer any relish for them. <i>We have 
changed.</i> Yet we are apt to believe the change any where rather than 
in ourselves. Indeed we are for the most part like Launcelot in the 
play.</p>

<br>
<center>THE LOYALTY OF VIRGINIA.</center>
<br>
<p>In our last number, while reviewing the Ecclesiastical History of 
Dr. Hawks, we had occasion to speak of those portions of Mr. George 
Bancroft's <i>United Slates</i>, which have reference to the loyalty of 
Virginia immediately before and during the Protectorate of Cromwell. 
Since the publication of our remarks, a personal interview with Mr. 
Bancroft, and an examination, especially, of one or two passages in 
his History, have been sufficient to convince us that injustice (of 
course unintentional) has been done that gentleman, not only by 
ourselves, but by Dr. Hawks and others.</p>

<p>In our own review alluded to above, we concluded, in the following 
words, a list of arguments adduced, <i>or supposed to be adduced</i>, in 
proof of Virginia's disloyalty.</p>

<p>"6. Virginia was infected with republicanism. She wished to set up 
for herself. Thus intent, she demands of Berkeley a distinct 
acknowledgment of her Assembly's supremacy. His reply was 'I am but 
the servant of the Assembly.' Berkeley, therefore, was republican, 
and his tumultuous election proves nothing but the republicanism of 
Virginia." To which our reply was thus.</p>

<p>"6. The reasoning here is reasoning in a circle. Virginia is first 
declared republican. From this assumed fact, deductions are made 
which prove Berkeley so&mdash;and Berkeley's republicanism, thus proved, 
is made to establish that of Virginia. But Berkeley's answer (from 
which Mr. Bancroft has extracted the words, 'I am but the servant of 
the Assembly,') runs thus. 'You desire me to do that concerning your 
titles and claims to land in this northern part of America, which I 
am in no capacity to do: for I am but the servant of the Assembly: 
neither do they arrogate to themselves any power farther than the 
miserable distractions in England force them to. For when God shall 
be pleased to take away and dissipate the unnatural divisions of 
their native country, they will immediately return to their 
professed obedience.'&mdash;<i>Smith's New York</i>. It will be seen that Mr. 
Bancroft has been disingenuous in quoting only a <i>portion</i> of this 
sentence. <i>The whole</i> proves incontestibly that neither Berkeley nor 
the Assembly <i>arrogated to themselves any power beyond what they 
were forced to assume by circumstances</i>&mdash;in a word it proves their loyalty."</p>

<p>We are now, however, fully persuaded that Mr. Bancroft had not only 
no intention of representing Virginia as disloyal&mdash;but that his 
work, closely examined, will not admit of such interpretation. As an 
offset to our argument just quoted, we copy the following (the 
passage to which our remarks had reference) from page 245 of Mr. 
B.'s only published volume.</p>

<p>"On the death of Matthews, the Virginians were without a chief 
magistrate, just at the time when the resignation of Richard had 
left England without a government. The burgesses, who were 
immediately convened, resolving to become the arbiters of the fate 
of the colony, enacted 'that the supreme power of the government of 
this country shall be resident in the assembly, and all writs shall 
issue in its name, until there shall arrive from England a 
commission which the assembly itself shall adjudge to be lawful.' 
This being done, Sir William Berkeley was elected governor, and 
acknowledging the validity of the acts of the burgesses, whom it was 
expressly agreed he could in no event dissolve, he accepted the 
office to which he had been chosen, and recognized, without a 
scruple, the authority to which he owed his elevation. 'I am,' said 
he, 'but a servant of the assembly.' <i>Virginia did not lay claim to 
absolute independence; but anxiously awaited the settlement of 
affairs in England.</i>"</p>

<p>It will here be seen, that the words italicized beginning "Virginia 
did not lay claim," &amp;c. are very nearly, if not altogether 
equivalent to what we assume as proved by <i>the whole</i> of Berkeley's 
reply, viz. <i>that neither Berkeley nor the Assembly arrogated to 
themselves any power beyond what they were forced to assume by 
circumstances</i>. Our charge, therefore, of disingenuousness on the 
part of Mr. Bancroft in quoting only a portion of the answer, is 
evidently unsustained, and we can have no hesitation in recalling it.</p>

<p>At page 226 of the History of the United States, we note the 
following passage.</p>

<p>"At Christmas, 1648, there were trading in Virginia, ten ships from 
London, two from Bristol, twelve Hollanders, and seven from New 
England. The number of the colonists was already twenty thousand; 
and they, who had sustained no griefs, were not tempted to engage in 
the feuds by which the mother country was divided. They were 
attached to the cause of Charles, not because they loved monarchy, 
but because they cherished the liberties of which he had left them 
in undisturbed possession; and after his execution, though there 
were not wanting <i>some</i> who favored republicanism, <i>the government 
recognized his son without dispute. The loyalty of the Virginians 
did not escape the attention of the royal exile.</i> From his retreat 
in Breda he transmitted to Berkeley a new commission, and <i>Charles 
the Second, a fugitive from England, was still the sovereign of 
Virginia</i>."</p>

<p>This passage alone will render it evident that Mr. Bancroft's 
readers have been wrong in supposing him to maintain the disloyalty 
of the State. It cannot be denied, however, (and if we understand 
Mr. B. he does not himself deny it,) that there is, about some 
portions of his volume, an ambiguity, or perhaps a laxity of 
expression, which it would be as well to avoid hereafter. The note 
of Dr. Hawks we consider exceptionable, inasmuch as it is not 
sufficiently explanatory. The passages in Mr. B.'s History which we 
have noted above, and other passages equally decisive, were pointed 
out to Dr. Hawks. He should have therefore not only stated that Mr. 
B. disclaimed the intention of representing Virginia as republican, 
but also that his work, if accurately examined, would not admit of 
such interpretation. The question of Virginia's loyalty may now be 
considered as fully determined.</p>

<center>CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL.</center>

<p>It is with great pleasure, at the opportunity thus afforded us of 
correcting an error, that we give place to the following letter.</p>

<div align="right"><small><i>Philadelphia, March 25, 1836</i></small>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<blockquote><small>S<small>IR</small>,&mdash;A mistake, evidently unintentional, having appeared in the 
February number of your journal for 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"><small>[p. 318]</small></a></span> this year, we feel 
convinced you will, upon proper representation, take pleasure in 
correcting it, as an impression so erroneous might have a 
prejudicial tendency. Under the notice of the Eulogies on the Life 
and Character of the late Chief Justice Marshall, it is there stated 
that "for several years past Judge Marshall had suffered under a 
most excruciating malady. A surgical operation by Dr. Physick of 
Philadelphia at length procured him relief; but a hurt received in 
travelling last Spring seems to have caused a return of the former 
complaint with circumstances of aggravated pain and danger. Having 
revisited Philadelphia in the hope of again finding a cure, his 
disease there overpowered him, and he died on the 6th of July, 1835, 
in the 80th year of his age."</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>Now, sir, the above quotation is incorrect in the following respect: 
Judge Marshall never had a return of the complaint for which he was 
operated upon by Dr. Physick. After the demise of Chief Justice 
Marshall, it became our melancholy duty to make a <i>post mortem</i> 
examination, which we did in the most careful manner, and 
ascertained that his bladder did not contain one particle of 
calculous matter; its mucous coat was in a perfectly natural state, 
and exhibited not the slightest traces of irritation.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The cause of his death was a very diseased condition of the liver, 
which was enormously enlarged, and contained several tuberculous 
abscesses of great size; its pressure upon the stomach had the 
effect of dislodging this organ from its natural situation, and 
compressing it in such a manner, that for some time previous to his 
death it would not retain the smallest quantity of nutriment. By 
publishing this statement, you will oblige</small></blockquote>

<div align="right"><small>Yours, very respectfully,

<br>
<center>MAELZEL'S CHESS-PLAYER.</center>

<p>Perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general 
attention as the Chess-Player of Maelzel. Wherever seen it has been 
an object of intense curiosity, to all persons who think. Yet the 
question of its <i>modus operandi</i> is still undetermined. Nothing has 
been written on this topic which can be considered as decisive&mdash;and 
accordingly we find every where men of mechanical genius, of great 
general acuteness, and discriminative understanding, who make no 
scruple in pronouncing the Automaton a <i>pure machine</i>, unconnected 
with human agency in its movements, and consequently, beyond all 
comparison, the most astonishing of the inventions of mankind. And 
such it would undoubtedly be, were they right in their supposition. 
Assuming this hypothesis, it would be grossly absurd to compare with 
the Chess-Player, any similar thing of either modern or ancient 
days. Yet there have been many and wonderful automata. In Brewster's 
Letters on Natural Magic, we have an account of the most remarkable. 
Among these may be mentioned, as having beyond doubt existed, 
firstly, the coach invented by M. Camus for the amusement of Louis 
XIV when a child. A table, about four feet square, was introduced, 
into the room appropriated for the exhibition. Upon this table was 
placed a carriage, six inches in length, made of wood, and drawn by 
two horses of the same material. One window being down, a lady was 
seen on the back seat. A coachman held the reins on the box, and a 
footman and page were in their places behind. M. Camus now touched a 
spring; whereupon the coachman smacked his whip, and the horses 
proceeded in a natural manner, along the edge of the table, drawing 
after them the carriage. Having gone as far as possible in this 
direction, a sudden turn was made to the left, and the vehicle was 
driven at right angles to its former course, and still closely along 
the edge of the table. In this way the coach proceeded until it 
arrived opposite the chair of the young prince. It then stopped, the 
page descended and opened the door, the lady alighted, and presented 
a petition to her sovereign. She then re-entered. The page put up 
the steps, closed the door, and resumed his station. The coachman 
whipped his horses, and the carriage was driven back to its original 
position.</p>

<p>The magician of M. Maillardet is also worthy of notice. We copy the 
following account of it from the <i>Letters</i> before mentioned of Dr. 
B., who derived his information principally from the Edinburgh 
Encyclopædia.</p>

<p>"One of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen, is 
the Magician constructed by M. Maillardet, for the purpose of 
answering certain given questions. A figure, dressed like a 
magician, appears seated at the bottom of a wall, holding a wand in 
one hand, and a book in the other. A number of questions, ready 
prepared, are inscribed on oval medallions, and the spectator takes 
any of these he chooses, and to which he wishes an answer, and 
having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it, the drawer shuts 
with a spring till the answer is returned. The magician then arises 
from his seat, bows his head, describes circles with his wand, and 
consulting the book as if in deep thought, he lifts it towards his 
face. Having thus appeared to ponder over the proposed question, he 
raises his wand, and striking with it the wall above his head, two 
folding doors fly open, and display an appropriate answer to the 
question. The doors again close, the magician resumes his original 
position, and the drawer opens to return the medallion. There are 
twenty of these medallions, all containing different questions, to 
which the magician returns the most suitable and striking answers. 
The medallions are thin plates of brass, of an elliptical form, 
exactly resembling each other. Some of the medallions have a 
question inscribed on each side, both of which the magician answered 
in succession. If the drawer is shut without a medallion being put 
into it, the magician rises, consults his book, shakes his head, and 
resumes his seat. The folding doors remain shut, and the drawer is 
returned empty. If two medallions are put into the drawer together, 
an answer is returned only to the lower one. When the machinery is 
wound up, the movements continue about an hour, during which time 
about fifty questions may be answered. The inventor stated that the 
means by which the different medallions acted upon the machinery, so 
as to produce the proper answers to the questions which they 
contained, were extremely simple."</p>

<p>The duck of Vaucanson was still more remarkable. It was of the size 
of life, and so perfect an imitation of the living animal that all 
the spectators were deceived. It executed, says Brewster, all the 
natural movements <span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"><small><small>[p. 319]</small></small></a></span>
and gestures, it eat and drank with avidity, 
performed all the quick motions of the head and throat which are 
peculiar to the duck, and like it muddled the water which it drank 
with its bill. It produced also the sound of quacking in the most 
natural manner. In the anatomical structure the artist exhibited the 
highest skill. Every bone in the real duck had its representative in 
the automaton, and its wings were anatomically exact. Every cavity, 
apophysis, and curvature was imitated, and each bone executed its 
proper movements. When corn was thrown down before it, the duck 
stretched out its neck to pick it up, swallowed, and digested it.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Under the head <i>Androides</i> in the Edinburgh 
Encyclopædia may be found a full account of the principle automata 
of ancient and modern times.</small></blockquote>

<p>But if these machines were ingenious, what shall we think of the 
calculating machine of Mr. Babbage? What shall we think of an engine 
of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical and 
navigation tables to any given extent, but render the exactitude of 
its operations mathematically certain through its power of 
correcting its possible errors? What shall we think of a machine 
which can not only accomplish all this, but actually print off its 
elaborate results, when obtained, without the slightest intervention 
of the intellect of man? It will, perhaps, be said, in reply, that a 
machine such as we have described is altogether above comparison 
with the Chess-Player of Maelzel. By no means&mdash;it is altogether 
beneath it&mdash;that is to say provided we assume (what should never for 
a moment be assumed) that the Chess-Player is a <i>pure machine</i>, and 
performs its operations without any immediate human agency. 
Arithmetical or algebraical calculations are, from their very 
nature, fixed and determinate. Certain <i>data</i> being given, certain 
results necessarily and inevitably follow. These results have 
dependence upon nothing, and are influenced by nothing but the 
<i>data</i> originally given. And the question to be solved proceeds, or 
should proceed, to its final determination, by a succession of 
unerring steps liable to no change, and subject to no modification. 
This being the case, we can without difficulty conceive the 
<i>possibility</i> of so arranging a piece of mechanism, that upon 
starting it in accordance with the <i>data</i> of the question to be 
solved, it should continue its movements regularly, progressively, 
and undeviatingly towards the required solution, since these 
movements, however complex, are never imagined to be otherwise than 
finite and determinate. But the case is widely different with the 
Chess-Player. With him there is no determinate progression. No one 
move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other. From no 
particular disposition of the men at one period of a game can we 
predicate their disposition at a different period. Let us place the 
<i>first move</i> in a game of chess, in juxta-position with the <i>data</i> 
of an algebraical question, and their great difference will be 
immediately perceived. From the latter&mdash;from the <i>data</i>&mdash;the second 
step of the question, dependent thereupon, inevitably follows. It is 
modelled by the <i>data</i>. It must be <i>thus</i> and not otherwise. But 
from the first move in the game of chess no especial second move 
follows of necessity. In the algebraical question, as it proceeds 
towards solution, the <i>certainty</i> of its operations remains 
altogether unimpaired. The second step having been a consequence of 
the <i>data</i>, the third step is equally a consequence of the second, 
the fourth of the third, the fifth of the fourth, and so on, <i>and 
not possibly otherwise</i>, to the end. But in proportion to the 
progress made in a game of chess, is the <i>uncertainty</i> of each 
ensuing move. A few moves having been made, <i>no</i> step is certain. 
Different spectators of the game would advise different moves. All 
is then dependant upon the variable judgment of the players. Now 
even granting (what should not be granted) that the movements of the 
Automaton Chess-Player were in themselves determinate, they would be 
necessarily interrupted and disarranged by the indeterminate will of 
his antagonist. There is then no analogy whatever between the 
operations of the Chess-Player, and those of the calculating machine 
of Mr. Babbage, and if we choose to call the former a <i>pure machine</i> 
we must be prepared to admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the 
most wonderful of the inventions of mankind. Its original projector, 
however, Baron Kempelen, had no scruple in declaring it to be a 
"very ordinary piece of mechanism&mdash;a <i>bagatelle</i> whose effects 
appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the conception, and 
the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for promoting the 
illusion." But it is needless to dwell upon this point. It is quite 
certain that the operations of the Automaton are regulated by 
<i>mind</i>, and by nothing else. Indeed this matter is susceptible of a 
mathematical demonstration, <i>a priori</i>. The only question then is of 
the <i>manner</i> in which human agency is brought to bear. Before 
entering upon this subject it would be as well to give a brief 
history and description of the Chess-Player for the benefit of such 
of our readers as may never have had an opportunity of witnessing 
Mr. Maelzel's exhibition.</p>

<center><img src="images/turk.jpg" alt="chess player"></center>

<p>The Automaton Chess-Player was invented in 1769, by Baron Kempelen, 
a nobleman of Presburg in Hungary, who afterwards disposed of it, 
together with the secret of its operations, to its present 
possessor. Soon after its completion it was exhibited in Presburg, 
Paris, Vienna, and other continental cities. In 1783 and 1784, it 
was taken to London by Mr. Maelzel. Of late years it has visited the 
principal towns in the United States. Wherever seen, the most 
intense curiosity was excited by its appearance, and numerous have 
been the attempts, by men of all classes, to fathom the mystery of 
its evolutions. The cut above gives a tolerable representation of 
the figure as seen by the citizens of Richmond a few weeks ago. The 
right arm, however, should lie more at length upon the box, a 
chess-board should appear upon it, and the cushion should not be 
seen while the pipe is held. Some immaterial alterations have been 
made in the costume of the player since it came into the possession 
of Maelzel&mdash;the plume, for example, was not originally worn.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320"><small><small>[p. 320]</small></small></a></span>
<p>At the hour appointed for exhibition, a curtain is withdrawn, 
or folding doors are thrown open, and the machine rolled to within 
about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators, between whom and 
it (the machine) a rope is stretched. A figure is seen habited as a 
Turk, and seated, with its legs crossed, at a large box apparently 
of maple wood, which serves it as a table. The exhibiter will, if 
requested, roll the machine to any portion of the room, suffer it to 
remain altogether on any designated spot, or even shift its location 
repeatedly during the progress of a game. The bottom of the box is 
elevated considerably above the floor by means of the castors or 
brazen rollers on which it moves, a clear view of the surface 
immediately beneath the Automaton being thus afforded to the 
spectators. The chair on which the figure sits is affixed 
permanently to the box. On the top of this latter is a chess-board, 
also permanently affixed. The right arm of the Chess-Player is 
extended at full length before him, at right angles with his body, 
and lying, in an apparently careless position, by the side of the 
board. The back of the hand is upwards. The board itself is eighteen 
inches square. The left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow, and 
in the left hand is a pipe. A green drapery conceals the back of the 
Turk, and falls partially over the front of both shoulders. To judge 
from the external appearance of the box, it is divided into five 
compartments&mdash;three cupboards of equal dimensions, and two drawers 
occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the cupboards. The 
foregoing observations apply to the appearance of the Automaton upon 
its first introduction into the presence of the spectators.</p>

<p>Maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their view 
the mechanism of the machine. Taking from his pocket a bunch of keys 
he unlocks with one of them, door marked 1 in the cut above, and 
throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of all present. Its 
whole interior is apparently filled with wheels, pinions, levers, 
and other machinery, crowded very closely together, so that the eye 
can penetrate but a little distance into the mass. Leaving this door 
open to its full extent, he goes now round to the back of the box, 
and raising the drapery of the figure, opens another door situated 
precisely in the rear of the one first opened. Holding a lighted 
candle at this door, and shifting the position of the whole machine 
repeatedly at the same time, a bright light is thrown entirely 
through the cupboard, which is now clearly seen to be full, 
completely full, of machinery. The spectators being satisfied of 
this fact, Maelzel closes the back door, locks it, takes the key 
from the lock, lets fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round 
to the front. The door marked 1, it will be remembered, is still 
open. The exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies 
beneath the cupboards at the bottom of the box&mdash;for although there 
are apparently two drawers, there is really only one&mdash;the two 
handles and two key holes being intended merely for ornament. Having 
opened this drawer to its full extent, a small cushion, and a set of 
chessmen, fixed in a frame work made to support them 
perpendicularly, are discovered. Leaving this drawer, as well as 
cupboard No. 1 open, Maelzel now unlocks door No. 2, and door No. 3, 
which are discovered to be folding doors, opening into one and the 
same compartment. To the right of this compartment, however, (that 
is to say the spectators' right) a small division, six inches wide, 
and filled with machinery, is partitioned off. The main compartment 
itself (in speaking of that portion of the box visible upon opening 
doors 2 and 3, we shall always call it the main compartment) is 
lined with dark cloth and contains no machinery whatever beyond two 
pieces of steel, quadrant-shaped, and situated one in each of the 
rear top corners of the compartment. A small protuberance about 
eight inches square, and also covered with dark cloth, lies on the 
floor of the compartment near the rear corner on the spectators' 
left hand. Leaving doors No. 2 and No. 3 open as well as the drawer, 
and door No. 1, the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main 
compartment, and, unlocking another door there, displays clearly all 
the interior of the main compartment, by introducing a candle behind 
it and within it. The whole box being thus apparently disclosed to 
the scrutiny of the company, Maelzel, still leaving the doors and 
drawer open, rolls the Automaton entirely round, and exposes the 
back of the Turk by lifting up the drapery. A door about ten inches 
square is thrown open in the loins of the figure, and a smaller one 
also in the left thigh. The interior of the figure, as seen through 
these apertures, appears to be crowded with machinery. In general, 
every spectator is now thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and 
completely scrutinized, at one and the same time, every individual 
portion of the Automaton, and the idea of any person being concealed 
in the interior, during so complete an exhibition of that interior, 
if ever entertained, is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the 
extreme.</p>

<p>M. Maelzel, having rolled the machine back into its original 
position, now informs the company that the Automaton will play a 
game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him. This challenge 
being accepted, a small table is prepared for the antagonist, and 
placed close by the rope, but on the spectators' side of it, and so 
situated as not to prevent the company from obtaining a full view of 
the Automaton. From a drawer in this table is taken a set of 
chess-men, and Maelzel arranges them generally, but not always, with 
his own hands, on the chess board, which consists merely of the 
usual number of squares painted upon the table. The antagonist 
having taken his seat, the exhibiter approaches the drawer of the 
box, and takes therefrom the cushion, which, after removing the pipe 
from the hand of the Automaton, he places under its left arm as a 
support. Then taking also from the drawer the Automaton's set of 
chess-men, he arranges them upon the chess-board before the figure. 
He now proceeds to close the doors and to lock them&mdash;leaving the 
bunch of keys in door No. 1. He also closes the drawer, and, 
finally, winds up the machine, by applying a key to an aperture in 
the left end (the spectators' left) of the box. The game now 
commences&mdash;the Automaton taking the first move. The duration of the 
contest is usually limited to half an hour, but if it be not 
finished at the expiration of this period, and the antagonist still 
contend that he can beat the Automaton, M. Maelzel has seldom any 
objection to continue it. Not to weary the company, is the 
ostensible, and no doubt the real object of the limitation. It will 
of course be understood that when a move is made at his own table, 
by the antagonist, the corresponding move is made at the box of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321"><small><small>[p. 321]</small></small></a></span>
Automaton, by Maelzel himself, who then acts as the 
representative of the antagonist. On the other hand, when the Turk 
moves, the corresponding move is made at the table of the 
antagonist, also by M. Maelzel, who then acts as the representative 
of the Automaton. In this manner it is necessary that the exhibitor 
should often pass from one table to the other. He also frequently 
goes in rear of the figure to remove the chessmen which it has 
taken, and which it deposits, when taken, on the box to the left (to 
its own left) of the board. When the Automaton hesitates in relation 
to its move, the exhibitor is occasionally seen to place himself 
very near its right side, and to lay his hand, now and then, in a 
careless manner, upon the box. He has also a peculiar shuffle with 
his feet, calculated to induce suspicion of collusion with the 
machine in minds which are more cunning than sagacious. These 
peculiarities are, no doubt, mere mannerisms of M. Maelzel, or, if 
he is aware of them at all, he puts them in practice with a view of 
exciting in the spectators a false idea of pure mechanism in the 
Automaton.</p>

<p>The Turk plays with his left hand. All the movements of the arm are 
at right angles. In this manner, the hand (which is gloved and bent 
in a natural way,) being brought directly above the piece to be 
moved, descends finally upon it, the fingers receiving it, in most 
cases, without difficulty. Occasionally, however, when the piece is 
not precisely in its proper situation, the Automaton fails in his 
attempt at seizing it. When this occurs, no second effort is made, 
but the arm continues its movement in the direction originally 
intended, precisely as if the piece were in the fingers. Having thus 
designated the spot whither the move should have been made, the arm 
returns to its cushion, and Maelzel performs the evolution which the 
Automaton pointed out. At every movement of the figure machinery is 
heard in motion. During the progress of the game, the figure now and 
then rolls its eyes, as if surveying the board, moves its head, and 
pronounces the word <i>echec</i> (check) when necessary.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> If a false 
move be made by his antagonist, he raps briskly on the box with the 
fingers of his right hand, shakes his head roughly, and replacing 
the piece falsely moved, in its former situation, assumes the next 
move himself. Upon beating the game, he waves his head with an air 
of triumph, looks round complacently upon the spectators, and 
drawing his left arm farther back than usual, suffers his fingers 
alone to rest upon the cushion. In general, the Turk is 
victorious&mdash;once or twice he has been beaten. The game being ended, 
Maelzel will again, if desired, exhibit the mechanism of the box, in 
the same manner as before. The machine is then rolled back, and a 
curtain hides it from the view of the company.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> The making the Turk pronounce the word <i>echec</i>, is an 
improvement by M. Maelzel. When in possession of Baron Kempelen, the 
figure indicated a <i>check</i> by rapping on the box with his right 
hand.</small></blockquote>

<p>There have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the 
Automaton. The most general opinion in relation to it, an opinion 
too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better, 
was, as we have before said, that no immediate human agency was 
employed&mdash;in other words, that the machine was purely a machine and 
nothing else. Many, however maintained that the exhibiter himself 
regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means operating 
through the feet of the box. Others again, spoke confidently of a 
magnet. Of the first of these opinions we shall say nothing at 
present more than we have already said. In relation to the second it 
is only necessary to repeat what we have before stated, that the 
machine is rolled about on castors, and will, at the request of a 
spectator, be moved to and fro to any portion of the room, even 
during the progress of a game. The supposition of the magnet is also 
untenable&mdash;for if a magnet were the agent, any other magnet in the 
pocket of a spectator would disarrange the entire mechanism. The 
exhibiter, however, will suffer the most powerful loadstone to 
remain even upon the box during the whole of the exhibition.</p>

<p>The first attempt at a written explanation of the secret, at least 
the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge, was made 
in a large pamphlet printed at Paris in 1785. The author's 
hypothesis amounted to this&mdash;that a dwarf actuated the machine. This 
dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the opening of the box 
by thrusting his legs into two hollow cylinders, which were 
represented to be (but which are not) among the machinery in the 
cupboard No. 1, while his body was out of the box entirely, and 
covered by the drapery of the Turk. When the doors were shut, the 
dwarf was enabled to bring his body within the box&mdash;the noise 
produced by some portion of the machinery allowing him to do so 
unheard, and also to close the door by which he entered. The 
interior of the Automaton being then exhibited, and no person 
discovered, the spectators, says the author of this pamphlet, are 
satisfied that no one is within any portion of the machine. This 
whole hypothesis was too obviously absurd to require comment, or 
refutation, and accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention.</p>

<p>In 1789 a book was published at Dresden by M. I. F. Freyhere in 
which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery. Mr. 
Freyhere's book was a pretty large one, and copiously illustrated by 
colored engravings. His supposition was that "a well-taught boy very 
thin and tall of his age (sufficiently so that he could be concealed 
in a drawer almost immediately under the chess-board") played the 
game of chess and effected all the evolutions of the Automaton. This 
idea, although even more silly than that of the Parisian author, met 
with a better reception, and was in some measure believed to be the 
true solution of the wonder, until the inventor put an end to the 
discussion by suffering a close examination of the top of the box.</p>

<p>These bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others 
equally bizarre. Of late years however, an anonymous writer, by a 
course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical, has contrived to 
blunder upon a plausible solution&mdash;although we cannot consider it 
altogether the true one. His Essay was first published in a 
Baltimore weekly paper, was illustrated by cuts, and was entitled 
"An attempt to analyze the Automaton Chess-Player of M. Maelzel." 
This Essay we suppose to have been the original of the <i>pamphlet</i> to 
which Sir David Brewster alludes in his letters on Natural Magic, 
and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and 
satisfactory explanation. The <i>results</i> of the analysis are 
undoubtedly, in the main, just; but we can only account for 
Brewster's pronouncing the Essay a 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"><small><small>[p. 322]</small></small></a></span> thorough and satisfactory 
explanation, by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very 
cursory and inattentive perusal. In the compendium of the Essay, 
made use of in the Letters on Natural Magic, it is quite impossible 
to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the adequacy or 
inadequacy of the analysis, on account of the gross misarrangement 
and deficiency of the letters of reference employed. The same fault 
is to be found in the "Attempt &amp;c." as we originally saw it. The 
solution consists in a series of minute explanations, (accompanied 
by wood-cuts, the whole occupying many pages) in which the object is 
to show the <i>possibility</i> of <i>so shifting the partitions</i> of the 
box, as to allow a human being, concealed in the interior, to move 
portions of his body from one part of the box to another, during the 
exhibition of the mechanism&mdash;thus eluding the scrutiny of the 
spectators. There can be no doubt, as we have before observed, and 
as we will presently endeavor to show, that the principle, or rather 
the result, of this solution is the true one. Some person <i>is</i> 
concealed in the box during the whole time of exhibiting the 
interior. We object, however, to the whole verbose description of 
the <i>manner</i> in which the partitions are shifted, to accommodate the 
movements of the person concealed. We object to it as a mere theory 
assumed in the first place, and to which circumstances are 
afterwards made to adapt themselves. It was not, and could not have 
been, arrived at by any inductive reasoning. In whatever way the 
shifting is managed, it is of course concealed at every step from 
observation. To show that certain movements might possibly be 
effected in a certain way, is very far from showing that they are 
actually so effected. There may be an infinity of other methods by 
which the same results may be obtained. The probability of the one 
assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity. But, 
in reality, this particular point, the shifting of the partitions, 
is of no consequence whatever. It was altogether unnecessary to 
devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of proving what no one 
in his senses would deny&mdash;viz: that the wonderful mechanical genius 
of Baron Kempelen could invent the necessary means for shutting a 
door or slipping aside a pannel, with a human agent too at his 
service in actual contact with the pannel or the door, and the whole 
operations carried on, as the author of the Essay himself shows, and 
as we shall attempt to show more fully hereafter, entirely out of 
reach of the observation of the spectators.</p>

<p>In attempting ourselves an explanation of the Automaton, we will, in 
the first place, endeavor to show how its operations are effected, 
and afterwards describe, as briefly as possible, the nature of the 
<i>observations</i> from which we have deduced our result.</p>

<p>It will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject, that 
we repeat here in a few words, the routine adopted by the exhibiter 
in disclosing the interior of the box&mdash;a routine from which he 
<i>never</i> deviates in any material particular. In the first place he 
opens the door No. 1. Leaving this open, he goes round to the rear 
of the box, and opens a door precisely at the back of door No. 1. To 
this back door he holds a lighted candle. He then <i>closes the back 
door</i>, locks it, and, coming round to the front, opens the drawer to 
its full extent. This done, he opens the doors No. 2 and No. 3, (the 
folding doors) and displays the interior of the main compartment. 
Leaving open the main compartment, the drawer, and the front door of 
cupboard No. 1, he now goes to the rear again, and throws open the 
back door of the main compartment. In shutting up the box no 
particular order is observed, except that the folding doors are 
always closed before the drawer.</p>

<p>Now, let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into the 
presence of the spectators, a man is already within it. His body is 
situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard No. 1, (the rear 
portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip <i>en masse</i>, 
from the main compartment to the cupboard No. 1, as occasion may 
require,) and his legs lie at full length in the main compartment. 
When Maelzel opens the door No. 1, the man within is not in any 
danger of discovery, for the keenest eye cannot penetrate more than 
about two inches into the darkness within. But the case is otherwise 
when the back door of the cupboard No. 1, is opened. A bright light 
then pervades the cupboard, and the body of the man would be 
discovered if it were there. But it is not. The putting the key in 
the lock of the back door was a signal on hearing which the person 
concealed brought his body forward to an angle as acute as 
possible&mdash;throwing it altogether, or nearly so, into the main 
compartment. This, however, is a painful position, and cannot be 
long maintained. Accordingly we find that Maelzel <i>closes the back 
door</i>. This being done, there is no reason why the body of the man 
may not resume its former situation&mdash;for the cupboard is again so 
dark as to defy scrutiny. The drawer is now opened, and the legs of 
the person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly 
occupied.<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> There is, consequently, now no longer any part of the 
man in the main compartment&mdash;his body being behind the machinery in 
cupboard No. 1, and his legs in the space occupied by the drawer. 
The exhibiter, therefore, finds himself at liberty to display the 
main compartment. This he does&mdash;opening both its back and front 
doors&mdash;and no person is discovered. The spectators are now satisfied 
that the whole of the box is exposed to view&mdash;and exposed too, all 
portions of it at one and the same time. But of course this is not 
the case. They neither see the space behind the drawer, nor the 
interior of cupboard No. 1&mdash;the front door of which latter the 
exhibiter virtually shuts in shutting its back door. Maelzel, having 
now rolled the machine around, lifted up the drapery of the Turk, 
opened the doors in his back and thigh, and shown his trunk to be 
full of machinery, brings the whole back into its original position, 
and closes the doors. The man within is now at liberty to move 
about. He gets up into the body of the Turk just so high as to bring 
his eyes above the level of the chess-board. It is very probable 
that he seats himself upon the little square block or protuberance 
which is seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are 
open. In this position he sees the chess-board through the bosom of 
the Turk which is of gauze. Bringing his right arm across his 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"><small><small>[p. 323]</small></small></a></span>
breast he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left 
arm and the fingers of the figure. This machinery is situated just 
beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is consequently easily 
reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his 
right arm brought across the breast. The motions of the head and 
eyes, and of the right arm of the figure, as well as the sound 
<i>echec</i> are produced by other mechanism in the interior, and 
actuated at will by the man within. The whole of this 
mechanism&mdash;that is to say all the mechanism essential to the 
machine&mdash;is most probably contained within the little cupboard (of 
about six inches in breadth) partitioned off at the right (the 
spectators' right) of the main compartment.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> Sir David Brewster supposes that there is always a 
large space behind this drawer even when shut&mdash;in other words that 
the drawer is a "false drawer" and does not extend to the back of 
the box. But the idea is altogether untenable. So commonplace a 
trick would be immediately discovered&mdash;especially as the drawer is 
always opened to its full extent, and an opportunity thus afforded 
of comparing its depth with that of the box.</small></blockquote>

<p>In this analysis of the operations of the Automaton, we have 
purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the partitions 
are shifted, and it will now be readily comprehended that this point 
is a matter of no importance, since, by mechanism within the ability 
of any common carpenter, it might be effected in an infinity of 
different ways, and since we have shown that, however performed, it 
is performed out of the view of the spectators. Our result is 
founded upon the following <i>observations</i> taken during frequent 
visits to the exhibition of Maelzel.<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> Some of these <i>observations</i> are intended merely to 
prove that the machine must be regulated <i>by mind</i>, and it may be 
thought a work of supererogation to advance farther arguments in 
support of what has been already fully decided. But our object is to 
convince, in especial, certain of our friends upon whom a train of 
suggestive reasoning will have more influence than the most positive 
<i>a priori</i> demonstration.</small></blockquote>

<p>1. The moves of the Turk are not made at regular intervals of time, 
but accommodate themselves to the moves of the antagonist&mdash;although 
this point (of regularity) so important in all kinds of mechanical 
contrivance, might have been readily brought about by limiting the 
time allowed for the moves of the antagonist. For example, if this 
limit were three minutes, the moves of the Automaton might be made 
at any given intervals longer than three minutes. The fact then of 
irregularity, when regularity might have been so easily attained, 
goes to prove that regularity is unimportant to the action of the 
Automaton&mdash;in other words, that the Automaton is not <i>a pure 
machine</i>.</p>

<p>2. When the Automaton is about to move a piece, a distinct motion is 
observable just beneath the left shoulder, and which motion agitates 
in a slight degree, the drapery covering the front of the left 
shoulder. This motion invariably precedes, by about two seconds, the 
movement of the arm itself&mdash;and the arm never, in any instance, 
moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder. Now let the 
antagonist move a piece, and let the corresponding move be made by 
Maelzel, as usual, upon the board of the Automaton. Then let the 
antagonist narrowly watch the Automaton, until he detect the 
preparatory motion in the shoulder. Immediately upon detecting this 
motion, and before the arm itself begins to move, let him withdraw 
his piece, as if perceiving an error in his manœuvre. It will then 
be seen that the movement of the arm, which, in all other cases, 
immediately succeeds the motion in the shoulder, is withheld&mdash;is not 
made&mdash;although Maelzel has not yet performed, on the board of the 
Automaton, any move corresponding to the withdrawal of the 
antagonist. In this case, that the Automaton was about to move is 
evident&mdash;and that he did not move, was an effect plainly produced by 
the withdrawal of the antagonist, and without any intervention of Maelzel.</p>

<p>This fact fully proves, 1&mdash;that the intervention of Maelzel, in 
performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the 
Automaton, is not essential to the movements of the Automaton, 
2&mdash;that its movements are regulated by <i>mind</i>&mdash;by some person who 
sees the board of the antagonist, 3&mdash;that its movements are not 
regulated by the mind of Maelzel, whose back was turned towards the 
antagonist at the withdrawal of his move.</p>

<p>3. The Automaton does not invariably win the game. Were the machine 
a pure machine this would not be the case&mdash;it would always win. The 
<i>principle</i> being discovered by which a machine can be made to 
<i>play</i> a game of chess, an extension of the same principle would 
enable it to <i>win</i> a game&mdash;a farther extension would enable it to 
<i>win all</i> games&mdash;that is, to beat any possible game of an 
antagonist. A little consideration will convince any one that the 
difficulty of making a machine beat all games, is not in the least 
degree greater, as regards the principle of the operations 
necessary, than that of making it beat a single game. If then we 
regard the Chess-Player as a machine, we must suppose, (what is 
highly improbable,) that its inventor preferred leaving it 
incomplete to perfecting it&mdash;a supposition rendered still more 
absurd, when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would afford 
an argument against the possibility of its being a pure machine&mdash;the 
very argument we now adduce.</p>

<p>4. When the situation of the game is difficult or complex, we never 
perceive the Turk either shake his head or roll his eyes. It is only 
when his next move is obvious, or when the game is so circumstanced 
that to a man in the Automaton's place there would be no necessity 
for reflection. Now these peculiar movements of the head and eyes 
are movements customary with persons engaged in meditation, and the 
ingenious Baron Kempelen would have adapted these movements (were 
the machine a pure machine) to occasions proper for their 
display&mdash;that is, to occasions of complexity. But the reverse is 
seen to be the case, and this reverse applies precisely to our 
supposition of a man in the interior. When engaged in meditation 
about the game he has no time to think of setting in motion the 
mechanism of the Automaton by which are moved the head and the eyes. 
When the game, however, is obvious, he has time to look about him, 
and, accordingly, we see the head shake and the eyes roll.</p>

<p>5. When the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an 
examination of the back of the Turk, and when his drapery is lifted 
up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open, the interior of 
the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery. In scrutinizing this 
machinery while the Automaton was in motion, that is to say while 
the whole machine was moving on the castors, it appeared to us that 
certain portions of the mechanism changed their shape and position 
in a degree too great to be accounted for by the simple laws of 
perspective; and subsequent examinations convinced us that these 
undue alterations were attributable to mirrors in the interior of 
the trunk. The introduction of mirrors among the machinery could not 
have been <span class="pagenum"><a name="page324"><small><small>[p. 324]</small></small></a></span>
intended to influence, in any degree, the machinery 
itself. Their operation, whatever that operation should prove to be, 
must necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator. We at 
once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to the 
vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to give 
it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism. Now the direct 
inference from this is that the machine is not a pure machine. For 
if it were, the inventor, so far from wishing its mechanism to 
appear complex, and using deception for the purpose of giving it 
this appearance, would have been especially desirous of convincing 
those who witnessed his exhibition, of the <i>simplicity</i> of the means 
by which results so wonderful were brought about.</p>

<p>6. The external appearance, and, especially, the deportment of the 
Turk, are, when we consider them as imitations of <i>life</i>, but very 
indifferent imitations. The countenance evinces no ingenuity, and is 
surpassed, in its resemblance to the human face, by the very 
commonest of wax-works. The eyes roll unnaturally in the head, 
without any corresponding motions of the lids or brows. The arm, 
particularly, performs its operations in an exceedingly stiff, 
awkward, jerking, and rectangular manner. Now, all this is the 
result either of inability in Maelzel to do better, or of 
intentional neglect&mdash;accidental neglect being out of the question, 
when we consider that the whole time of the ingenious proprietor is 
occupied in the improvement of his machines. Most assuredly we must 
not refer the unlife-like appearances to inability&mdash;for all the rest 
of Maelzel's automata are evidence of his full ability to copy the 
motions and peculiarities of life with the most wonderful 
exactitude. The rope-dancers, for example, are inimitable. When the 
clown laughs, his lips, his eyes, his eye-brows, and 
eye-lids&mdash;indeed, all the features of his countenance&mdash;are imbued 
with their appropriate expressions. In both him and his companion, 
every gesture is so entirely easy, and free from the semblance of 
artificiality, that, were it not for the diminutiveness of their 
size, and the fact of their being passed from one spectator to 
another previous to their exhibition on the rope, it would be 
difficult to convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden 
automata were not living creatures. We cannot, therefore, doubt Mr. 
Maelzel's ability, and we must necessarily suppose that he 
intentionally suffered his Chess-Player to remain the same 
artificial and unnatural figure which Baron Kempelen (no doubt also 
through design) originally made it. What this design was it is not 
difficult to conceive. Were the Automaton life-like in its motions, 
the spectator would be more apt to attribute its operations to their 
true cause, (that is, to human agency within) than he is now, when 
the awkward and rectangular manœuvres convey the idea of pure and 
unaided mechanism.</p>

<p>7. When, a short time previous to the commencement of the game, the 
Automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual, an ear in any 
degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a system of 
machinery, will not fail to discover, instantaneously, that the axis 
turned by the key in the box of the Chess-Player, cannot possibly be 
connected with either a weight, a spring, or any system of machinery 
whatever. The inference here is the same as in our last observation. 
The winding up is inessential to the operations of the Automaton, 
and is performed with the design of exciting in the spectators the 
false idea of mechanism.</p>

<p>8. When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel&mdash;"Is the 
Automaton a pure machine or not?" his reply is invariably the 
same&mdash;"I will say nothing about it." Now the notoriety of the 
Automaton, and the great curiosity it has every where excited, are 
owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it <i>is</i> a pure 
machine, than to any other circumstance. Of course, then, it is the 
interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure machine. And 
what more obvious, and more effectual method could there be of 
impressing the spectators with this desired idea, than a positive 
and explicit declaration to that effect? On the other hand, what 
more obvious and effectual method could there be of exciting a 
disbelief in the Automaton's being a pure machine, than by 
withholding such explicit declaration? For, people will naturally 
reason thus,&mdash;It is Maelzel's interest to represent this thing a 
pure machine&mdash;he refuses to do so, directly, in words, although he 
does not scruple, and is evidently anxious to do so, indirectly by 
actions&mdash;were it actually what he wishes to represent it by actions, 
he would gladly avail himself of the more direct testimony of 
words&mdash;the inference is, that a consciousness of its <i>not</i> being a 
pure machine, is the reason of his silence&mdash;his actions cannot 
implicate him in a falsehood&mdash;his words may.</p>

<p>9. When, in exhibiting the interior of the box, Maelzel has thrown 
open the door No. 1, and also the door immediately behind it, he 
holds a lighted candle at the back door (as mentioned above) and 
moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of convincing the 
company that the cupboard No. 1 is entirely filled with machinery. 
When the machine is thus moved about, it will be apparent to any 
careful observer, that whereas that portion of the machinery near 
the front door No. 1, is perfectly steady and unwavering, the 
portion farther within fluctuates, in a very slight degree, with the 
movements of the machine. This circumstance first aroused in us the 
suspicion that the more remote portion of the machinery was so 
arranged as to be easily slipped, <i>en masse</i>, from its position when 
occasion should require it. This occasion we have already stated to 
occur when the man concealed within brings his body into an erect 
position upon the closing of the back door.</p>

<p>10. Sir David Brewster states the figure of the Turk to be of the 
size of life&mdash;but in fact it is far above the ordinary size. Nothing 
is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude. The body of 
the Automaton is generally insulated, and, having no means of 
immediately comparing it with any human form, we suffer ourselves to 
consider it as of ordinary dimensions. This mistake may, however, be 
corrected by observing the Chess-Player when, as is sometimes the 
case, the exhibiter approaches it. Mr. Maelzel, to be sure, is not 
very tall, but upon drawing near the machine, his head will be found 
at least eighteen inches below the head of the Turk, although the 
latter, it will be remembered, is in a sitting position.</p>

<p>11. The box behind which the Automaton is placed, is precisely three 
feet six inches long, two feet four inches deep, and two feet six 
inches high. These dimensions are fully sufficient for the 
accommodation of a man very much above the common size&mdash;and the main 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"><small><small>[p. 325]</small></small></a></span>
compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man in 
the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person concealed. 
As these are facts, which any one who doubts them may prove by 
actual calculation, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon them. We 
will only suggest that, although the top of the box is apparently a 
board of about three inches in thickness, the spectator may satisfy 
himself by stooping and looking up at it when the main compartment 
is open, that it is in reality very thin. The height of the drawer 
also will be misconceived by those who examine it in a cursory 
manner. There is a space of about three inches between the top of 
the drawer as seen from the exterior, and the bottom of the 
cupboard&mdash;a space which must be included in the height of the 
drawer. These contrivances to make the room within the box appear 
less than it actually is, are referrible to a design on the part of 
the inventor, to impress the company again with a false idea, viz. 
that no human being can be accommodated within the box.</p>

<p>12. The interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with 
<i>cloth</i>. This cloth we suppose to have a twofold object. A portion 
of it may form, when tightly stretched, the only partitions which 
there is any necessity for removing during the changes of the man's 
position, viz: the partition between the rear of the main 
compartment and the rear of the cupboard No. 1, and the partition 
between the main compartment, and the space behind the drawer when 
open. If we imagine this to be the case, the difficulty of shifting 
the partitions vanishes at once, if indeed any such difficulty could 
be supposed under any circumstances to exist. The second object of 
the cloth is to deaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned 
by the movements of the person within.</p>

<p>13. The antagonist (as we have before observed) is not suffered to 
play at the board of the Automaton, but is seated at some distance 
from the machine. The reason which, most probably, would be assigned 
for this circumstance, if the question were demanded, is, that were 
the antagonist otherwise situated, his person would intervene 
between the machine and the spectators, and preclude the latter from 
a distinct view. But this difficulty might be easily obviated, 
either by elevating the seats of the company, or by turning the end 
of the box towards them during the game. The true cause of the 
restriction is, perhaps, very different. Were the antagonist seated 
in contact with the box, the secret would be liable to discovery, by 
his detecting, with the aid of a quick ear, the breathings of the 
man concealed.</p>

<p>14. Although M. Maelzel, in disclosing the interior of the machine, 
sometimes slightly deviates from the <i>routine</i> which we have pointed 
out, yet <i>never</i> in any instance does he <i>so</i> deviate from it as to 
interfere with our solution. For example, he has been known to open, 
first of all, the drawer&mdash;but he never opens the main compartment 
without first closing the back door of cupboard No. 1&mdash;he never 
opens the main compartment without first pulling out the drawer&mdash;he 
never shuts the drawer without first shutting the main 
compartment&mdash;he never opens the back door of cupboard No. 1 while 
the main compartment is open&mdash;and the game of chess is never 
commenced until the whole machine is closed. Now, if it were 
observed that <i>never, in any single instance</i>, did M. Maelzel differ 
from the routine we have pointed out as necessary to our solution, 
it would be one of the strongest possible arguments in corroboration 
of it&mdash;but the argument becomes infinitely strengthened if we duly 
consider the circumstance that he <i>does occasionally</i> deviate from 
the routine, but never does <i>so</i> deviate as to falsify the solution.</p>

<p>15. There are six candles on the board of the Automaton during 
exhibition. The question naturally arises&mdash;"Why are so many 
employed, when a single candle, or, at farthest, two, would have 
been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of the 
board, in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition room 
always is&mdash;when, moreover, if we suppose the machine a <i>pure 
machine</i>, there can be no necessity for so much light, or indeed any 
light at all, to enable <i>it</i> to perform its operations&mdash;and when, 
especially, only a single candle is placed upon the table of the 
antagonist?" The first and most obvious inference is, that so strong 
a light is requisite to enable the man within to see through the 
transparent material (probably fine gauze) of which the breast of 
the Turk is composed. But when we consider the <i>arrangement</i> of the 
candles, another reason immediately presents itself. There are six 
lights (as we have said before) in all. Three of these are on each 
side of the figure. Those most remote from the spectators are the 
longest&mdash;those in the middle are about two inches shorter&mdash;and those 
nearest the company about two inches shorter still&mdash;and the candles 
on one side differ in height from the candles respectively opposite 
on the other, by a ratio different from two inches&mdash;that is to say, 
the longest candle on one side is about three inches shorter than 
the longest candle on the other, and so on. Thus it will be seen 
that no two of the candles are of the same height, and thus also the 
difficulty of ascertaining the <i>material</i> of the breast of the 
figure (against which the light is especially directed) is greatly 
augmented by the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the 
rays&mdash;crossings which are brought about by placing the centres of 
radiation all upon different levels.</p>

<p>16. While the Chess-Player was in possession of Baron Kempelen, it 
was more than once observed, first, that an Italian in the suite of 
the Baron was never visible during the playing of a game at chess by 
the Turk, and, secondly, that the Italian being taken seriously ill, 
the exhibition was suspended until his recovery. This Italian 
professed a <i>total</i> ignorance of the game of chess, although all 
others of the suite played well. Similar observations have been made 
since the Automaton has been purchased by Maelzel. There is a man, 
<i>Schlumberger</i>, who attends him wherever he goes, but who has no 
ostensible occupation other than that of assisting in the packing 
and unpacking of the automata. This man is about the medium size, 
and has a remarkable stoop in the shoulders. Whether he professes to 
play chess or not, we are not informed. It is quite certain, 
however, that he is never to be seen during the exhibition of the 
Chess-Player, although frequently visible just before and just after 
the exhibition. Moreover, some years ago Maelzel visited Richmond 
with his automata, and exhibited them, we believe, in the house now 
occupied by M. Bossieux as a Dancing Academy. <i>Schlumberger</i> was 
suddenly taken ill, and during his illness there was no exhibition 
of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"><small><small>[p. 326]</small></small></a></span>
Chess-Player. These facts are well known to many of our 
citizens. The reason assigned for the suspension of the 
Chess-Player's performances, was <i>not</i> the illness of 
<i>Schlumberger</i>. The inferences from all this we leave, without 
farther comment, to the reader.</p>

<p>17. The Turk plays with his <i>left</i> arm. A circumstance so remarkable 
cannot be accidental. Brewster takes no notice of it whatever, 
beyond a mere statement, we believe, that such is the fact. The 
early writers of treatises on the Automaton, seem not to have 
observed the matter at all, and have no reference to it. The author 
of the pamphlet alluded to by Brewster, mentions it, but 
acknowledges his inability to account for it. Yet it is obviously 
from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as this that 
deductions are to be made (if made at all) which shall lead us to 
the truth.</p>

<p>The circumstance of the Automaton's playing with his left hand 
cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine, considered 
merely as such. Any mechanical arrangement which would cause the 
figure to move, in any given manner, the left arm&mdash;could, if 
reversed, cause it to move, in the same manner, the right. But these 
principles cannot be extended to the human organization, wherein 
there is a marked and radical difference in the construction, and, 
at all events, in the powers, of the right and left arms. Reflecting 
upon this latter fact, we naturally refer the incongruity noticeable 
in the Chess-Player to this peculiarity in the human organization. 
If so, we must imagine some <i>reversion</i>&mdash;for the Chess-Player plays 
precisely as a man <i>would not</i>. These ideas, once entertained, are 
sufficient of themselves, to suggest the notion of a man in the 
interior. A few more imperceptible steps lead us, finally, to the 
result. The Automaton plays with his left arm, because under no 
other circumstances could the man within play with his right&mdash;a 
<i>desideratum</i> of course. Let us, for example, imagine the Automaton 
to play with his right arm. To reach the machinery which moves the 
arm, and which we have before explained to lie just beneath the 
shoulder, it would be necessary for the man within either to use his 
right arm in an exceedingly painful and awkward position, (viz. 
brought up close to his body and tightly compressed between his body 
and the side of the Automaton,) or else to use his left arm brought 
across his breast. In neither case could he act with the requisite 
ease or precision. On the contrary, the Automaton playing, as it 
actually does, with the left arm, all difficulties vanish. The right 
arm of the man within is brought across his breast, and his right 
fingers act, without any constraint, upon the machinery in the 
shoulder of the figure.</p>

<p>We do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged 
against this solution of the Automaton Chess-Player.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the detailed notice which we propose of the 
volumes before us, we wish to speak a few words in regard to the 
present state of American criticism.</p>

<p>It must be visible to all who meddle with literary matters, that of 
late years a thorough revolution has been effected in the censorship 
of our press. That this revolution is infinitely for the worse we 
believe. There was a time, it is true, when we cringed to foreign 
opinion&mdash;let us even say when we paid a most servile deference to 
British critical dicta. That an American book could, by any 
possibility, be worthy perusal, was an idea by no means extensively 
prevalent in the land; and if we were induced to read at all the 
productions of our native writers, it was only after repeated 
assurances from England that such productions were not altogether 
contemptible. But there was, at all events, a shadow of excuse, and 
a slight basis of reason for a subserviency so grotesque. Even now, 
perhaps, it would not be far wrong to assert that such basis of 
reason may still exist. Let us grant that in many of the abstract 
sciences&mdash;that even in Theology, in Medicine, in Law, in Oratory, in 
the Mechanical Arts, we have no competitors whatever, still nothing 
but the most egregious national vanity would assign us a place, in 
the matter of Polite Literature, upon a level with the elder and 
riper climes of Europe, the earliest steps of whose children are 
among the groves of magnificently endowed Academies, and whose 
innumerable men of leisure, and of consequent learning, drink daily 
from those august fountains of inspiration which burst around them 
every where from out the tombs of their immortal dead, and from out 
their hoary and trophied monuments of chivalry and song. In paying 
then, as a nation, a respectful and not undue deference to a 
supremacy rarely questioned but by prejudice or ignorance, we 
should, of course, be doing nothing more than acting in a rational 
manner. The <i>excess</i> of our subserviency was blameable&mdash;but, as we 
have before said, this very excess might have found a shadow of 
excuse in the strict justice, if properly regulated, of the 
principle from which it issued. Not so, however, with our present 
follies. We are becoming boisterous and arrogant in the pride of a 
too speedily assumed literary freedom. We throw off, with the most 
presumptuous and unmeaning hauteur, <i>all</i> deference whatever to 
foreign opinion&mdash;we forget, in the puerile inflation of vanity, that 
<i>the world</i> is the true theatre of the biblical histrio&mdash;we get up a 
hue and cry about the necessity of encouraging native writers of 
merit&mdash;we blindly fancy that we can accomplish this by 
indiscriminate puffing of good, bad, and indifferent, without taking 
the trouble to consider that what we choose to denominate 
encouragement is thus, by its general application, rendered 
precisely the reverse. In a word, so far from being ashamed of the 
many disgraceful literary failures to which our own inordinate 
vanities and misapplied patriotism have lately given birth, and so 
far from deeply lamenting that these daily puerilities are of home 
manufacture, we adhere pertinaciously to our original blindly 
conceived idea, and thus often find ourselves involved in the gross 
paradox of liking a stupid book the better, because, sure enough, 
its stupidity is American.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> This charge of indiscriminate puffing will, of course, 
only apply to the <i>general</i> character of our criticism&mdash;there are 
some noble exceptions. We wish also especially to discriminate 
between those <i>notices</i> of new works which are intended merely to 
call public attention to them, and deliberate criticism on the works 
themselves.</small></blockquote>

<p>Deeply lamenting this unjustifiable state of public 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"><small><small>[p. 327]</small></small></a></span> feeling, 
it has been our constant endeavor, since assuming the Editorial 
duties of this Journal, to stem, with what little abilities we 
possess, a current so disastrously undermining the health and 
prosperity of our literature. We have seen our efforts applauded by 
men whose applauses we value. From all quarters we have received 
abundant private as well as public testimonials in favor of our 
<i>Critical Notices</i>, and, until very lately, have heard from no 
respectable source one word impugning their integrity or candor. In 
looking over, however, a number of the New York Commercial 
Advertiser, we meet with the following paragraph.</p>

<blockquote><small>The last number of the Southern Literary Messenger is very readable 
and respectable. The contributions to the Messenger are much better 
than the original matter. The critical department of this work&mdash;much 
as it would seem to boast itself of impartiality and 
discernment,&mdash;is in our opinion decidedly <i>quacky</i>. There is in it a 
great assumption of acumen, which is completely unsustained. Many a 
work has been slashingly condemned therein, of which the critic 
himself could not write a page, were he to die for it. This 
affectation of eccentric sternness in criticism, without the power 
to back one's suit withal, so far from deserving praise, as some 
suppose, merits the strongest reprehension.&mdash;[<i>Philadelphia 
Gazette</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>We are entirely of opinion with the Philadelphia Gazette in relation 
to the Southern Literary Messenger, and take this occasion to 
express our total dissent from the numerous and lavish encomiums we 
have seen bestowed upon its critical notices. Some few of them have 
been judicious, fair and candid; bestowing praise and censure with 
judgment and impartiality; but by far the greater number of those we 
have read, have been flippant, unjust, untenable and uncritical. The 
duty of the critic is to act as judge, not as enemy, of the writer 
whom he reviews; a distinction of which the Zoilus of the Messenger 
seems not to be aware. It is possible to review a book severely, 
without bestowing opprobrious epithets upon the writer; to condemn 
with courtesy, if not with kindness. The critic of the Messenger has 
been eulogized for his scorching and scarifying abilities, and he 
thinks it incumbent upon him to keep up his reputation in that line, 
by sneers, sarcasm, and downright abuse; by straining his vision 
with microscopic intensity in search of faults, and shutting his 
eyes, with all his might, to beauties. Moreover, we have detected 
him, more than once, in blunders quite as gross as those on which it 
was his pleasure to descant.<small><sup>2</sup></small></small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> In addition to these things we observe, in the New York 
Mirror, what follows: "Those who have read the Notices of American 
books in a certain Southern Monthly, which is striving to gain 
notoriety by the loudness of its abuse, may find amusement in the 
sketch on another page, entitled 'The Successful Novel.' The 
Southern Literary Messenger knows ==&gt;<i>by experience</i>&lt;== what it is 
to write a successless novel." We have, in this case, only to deny, 
flatly, the assertion of the Mirror. The Editor of the Messenger 
never in his life wrote or published, or attempted to publish, a 
novel either successful or <i>successless</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>In the paragraph from the Philadelphia Gazette, (which is edited by 
Mr. Willis Gaylord Clark, one of the Editors of the Knickerbocker) 
we find nothing at which we have any desire to take exception. Mr. 
C. has a right to think us <i>quacky</i> if he pleases, and we do not 
remember having assumed for a moment that we could write a single 
line of the works we have reviewed. But there is something 
equivocal, to say the least, in the remarks of Col. Stone. He 
acknowledges that "<i>some</i> of our notices have been judicious, fair, 
and candid, bestowing praise and censure with judgment and 
impartiality." This being the case, how can he reconcile his <i>total</i> 
dissent from the public verdict in our favor, with the dictates of 
justice? We are accused too of bestowing "opprobrious epithets" upon 
writers whom we review, and in the paragraph so accusing us we are 
called nothing less than "flippant, unjust, and uncritical."</p>

<p>But there is another point of which we disapprove. While in our 
reviews we have at all times been particularly careful <i>not</i> to deal 
in generalities, and have never, if we remember aright, advanced in 
any single instance an unsupported assertion, our accuser has 
forgotten to give us any better evidence of our flippancy, 
injustice, personality, and gross blundering, than the solitary 
<i>dictum</i> of Col. Stone. We call upon the Colonel for assistance in 
this dilemma. We wish to be shown our blunders that we may correct 
them&mdash;to be made aware of our flippancy, that we may avoid it 
hereafter&mdash;and above all to have our personalities pointed out that 
we may proceed forthwith with a repentant spirit, to make the 
<i>amende honorable</i>. In default of this aid from the Editor of the 
Commercial we shall take it for granted that we are neither 
blunderers, flippant, personal, nor unjust.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25">

<p>Who will deny that in regard to individual poems no definitive 
opinions can exist, so long as to Poetry in the abstract we attach 
no definitive idea? Yet it is a common thing to hear our critics, 
day after day, pronounce, with a positive air, laudatory or 
condemnatory sentences, <i>en masse</i>, upon metrical works of whose 
merits and demerits they have, in the first place, virtually 
confessed an utter ignorance, in confessing ignorance of all 
determinate principles by which to regulate a decision. Poetry has 
never been defined to the satisfaction of all parties. Perhaps, in 
the present condition of language it never will be. Words cannot hem 
it in. Its intangible and purely spiritual nature refuses to be 
bound down within the widest horizon of mere sounds. But it is not, 
therefore, misunderstood&mdash;at least, not by all men is it 
misunderstood. Very far from it. If, indeed, there be any one circle 
of thought distinctly and palpably marked out from amid the jarring 
and tumultuous chaos of human intelligence, it is that evergreen and 
radiant Paradise which the true poet knows, and knows alone, as the 
limited realm of his authority&mdash;as the circumscribed Eden of his 
dreams. But a definition is a thing of words&mdash;a conception of ideas. 
And thus while we readily believe that Poesy, the term, it will be 
troublesome, if not impossible to define&mdash;still, with its image 
vividly existing in the world, we apprehend no difficulty in so 
describing Poesy, the Sentiment, as to imbue even the most obtuse 
intellect with a comprehension of it sufficiently distinct for all 
the purposes of practical analysis.</p>

<p>To look upwards from any existence, material or immaterial, to its 
<i>design</i>, is, perhaps, the most direct, and the most unerring method 
of attaining a just notion of the nature of the existence itself. 
Nor is the principle at fault when we turn our eyes from Nature even 
to Nature's God. We find certain faculties implanted within us, and 
arrive at a more plausible conception of the character and 
attributes of those faculties, by considering, with what finite 
judgment we possess, the <i>intention</i> of the Deity in so implanting 
them within us, than by any actual investigation of their powers, or 
any speculative deductions from their visible and material effects. 
Thus, for example, we discover in all men a disposition to look with 
reverence upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"><small><small>[p. 328]</small></small></a></span>
superiority, whether real or supposititious. In 
some, this disposition is to be recognized with difficulty, and, in 
very peculiar cases, we are occasionally even led to doubt its 
existence altogether, until circumstances beyond the common routine 
bring it accidentally into development. In others again it forms a 
prominent and distinctive feature of character, and is rendered 
palpably evident in its excesses. But in all human beings it is, in 
a greater or less degree, finally perceptible. It has been, 
therefore, justly considered a primitive sentiment. Phrenologists 
call it Veneration. It is, indeed, the instinct given to man by God 
as security for his own worship. And although, preserving its 
nature, it becomes perverted from its principal purpose, and 
although, swerving from that purpose, it serves to modify the 
relations of human society&mdash;the relations of father and child, of 
master and slave, of the ruler and the ruled&mdash;its primitive essence 
is nevertheless the same, and by a reference to primal causes, may 
at any moment be determined.</p>

<p>Very nearly akin to this feeling, and liable to the same analysis, 
is the Faculty of Ideality&mdash;which is the sentiment of Poesy. This 
sentiment is the sense of the beautiful, of the sublime, and of the 
mystical.<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> Thence spring immediately admiration of the fair 
flowers, the fairer forests, the bright valleys and rivers and 
mountains of the Earth&mdash;and love of the gleaming stars and other 
burning glories of Heaven&mdash;and, mingled up inextricably with this 
love and this admiration of Heaven and of Earth, the unconquerable 
desire&mdash;<i>to know</i>. Poesy is the sentiment of Intellectual Happiness 
here, and the Hope of a higher Intellectual Happiness hereafter.<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> 
Imagination is its Soul.<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> With the <i>passions</i> of mankind&mdash;although 
it may modify them greatly&mdash;although it may exalt, or inflame, or 
purify, or control them&mdash;it would require little ingenuity to prove 
that it has no inevitable, and indeed no necessary co-existence. We 
have hitherto spoken of Poetry in the abstract: we come now to speak 
of it in its every-day acceptation&mdash;that is to say, of the practical 
result arising from the sentiment we have considered.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> We separate the sublime and the mystical&mdash;for, despite 
of high authorities, we are firmly convinced that the latter <i>may</i> 
exist, in the most vivid degree, without giving rise to the sense of 
the former.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> The consciousness of this truth was possessed by no 
mortal more fully than by Shelley, although he has only once 
especially alluded to it. In his <i>Hymn to Intellectual Beauty</i> we 
find these lines.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> Imagination is, possibly, in man, a lesser degree of 
the creative power in God. What the Deity imagines, <i>is</i>, but <i>was 
not</i> before. What man imagines, <i>is</i>, but <i>was</i> also. The mind of 
man cannot imagine what <i>is not</i>. This latter point may be 
demonstrated.&mdash;<i>See Les Premiers Traits de L'Erudition Universelle, 
par M. Le Baron de Bielfield, 1767</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>And now it appears evident, that since Poetry, in this new sense, 
<i>is</i> the practical result, expressed in language, of this Poetic 
Sentiment in certain individuals, the only proper method of testing 
the merits of a poem is by measuring its capabilities of exciting 
the Poetic Sentiment in others. And to this end we have many 
aids&mdash;in observation, in experience, in ethical analysis, and in the 
dictates of common sense. Hence the <i>Poeta nascitur</i>, which is 
indisputably true if we consider the Poetic Sentiment, becomes the 
merest of absurdities when we regard it in reference to the 
practical result. We do not hesitate to say that a man highly 
endowed with the powers of Causality&mdash;that is to say, a man of 
metaphysical acumen&mdash;will, even with a very deficient share of 
Ideality, compose a finer poem (if we test it, as we should, by its 
measure of exciting the Poetic Sentiment) than one who, without such 
metaphysical acumen, shall be gifted, in the most extraordinary 
degree, with the faculty of Ideality. For a poem is not the Poetic 
faculty, but <i>the means</i> of exciting it in mankind. Now these means 
the metaphysician may discover by analysis of their effects in other 
cases than his own, without even conceiving the nature of these 
effects&mdash;thus arriving at a result which the unaided Ideality of his 
competitor would be utterly unable, except by accident, to attain. 
It is more than possible that the man who, of all writers, living or 
dead, has been most successful in writing the purest of all 
poems&mdash;that is to say, poems which excite most purely, most 
exclusively, and most powerfully the imaginative faculties in 
men&mdash;owed his extraordinary and almost magical pre-eminence rather 
to metaphysical than poetical powers. We allude to the author of 
Christabel, of the Rime of the Auncient Mariner, and of Love&mdash;to 
Coleridge&mdash;whose head, if we mistake not its character, gave no 
great phrenological tokens of Ideality, while the organs of 
Causality and Comparison were most singularly developed.</p>

<p>Perhaps at this particular moment there are no American poems held 
in so high estimation by our countrymen, as the poems of Drake, and 
of Halleck. The exertions of Mr. George Dearborn have no doubt a far 
greater share in creating this feeling than the lovers of literature 
for its own sake and spiritual uses would be willing to admit. We 
have indeed seldom seen more beautiful volumes than the volumes now 
before us. But an adventitious interest of a loftier nature&mdash;the 
interest of the living in the memory of the beloved dead&mdash;attaches 
itself to the few literary remains of Drake. The poems which are now 
given to us with his name are nineteen in number; and whether all, 
or whether even the best of his writings, it is our present purpose 
to speak of these alone, since upon this edition his poetical 
reputation to all time will most probably depend.</p>

<p>It is only lately that we have read <i>The Culprit Fay</i>. This is a 
poem of six hundred and forty irregular lines, generally iambic, and 
divided into thirty six stanzas, of 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"><small><small>[p. 329]</small></small></a></span> unequal length. The scene 
of the narrative, as we ascertain from the single line,</p>

<center>The moon looks down on old <i>Cronest</i>,</center>

<p>is principally in the vicinity of West Point on the Hudson. The plot 
is as follows. An Ouphe, one of the race of Fairies, has "broken his 
vestal vow,"</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem33">
	<tr><td>He has loved an earthly maid<br>
  And left for her his woodland shade;<br>
  He has lain upon her lip of dew,<br>
  And sunned him in her eye of blue,<br>
  Fann'd her cheek with his wing of air,<br>
  Play'd with the ringlets of her hair,<br>
  And, nestling on her snowy breast,<br>
  Forgot the lily-king's behest&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>in short, he has broken Fairy-law in becoming enamored of a mortal. 
The result of this misdemeanor we could not express so well as the 
poet, and will therefore make use of the language put into the mouth 
of the Fairy-King who reprimands the criminal.</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem34">
	<tr><td>Fairy! Fairy! list and mark,<br>

  Thy flame-wood lamp is quench'd and dark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy wings are dyed with a deadly stain.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Ouphe being in this predicament, it has become necessary that 
his case and crime should be investigated by a jury of his fellows, 
and to this end the "shadowy tribes of air" are summoned by the 
"sentry elve" who has been awakened by the "wood-tick"&mdash;are summoned 
we say to the "elfin-court" at midnight to hear the doom of the 
<i>Culprit Fay</i>.</p>

<p>"Had a stain been found on the earthly fair" whose blandishments so 
bewildered the litle Ouphe, his punishment had been severe indeed. 
In such case he would have been (as we learn from the Fairy judge's 
exposition of the criminal code,)</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, for the Culprit, his mistress is proved to be 
of "sinless mind" and under such redeeming circumstances the 
sentence is, mildly, as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon this sin, and upon this sentence, depends the web of the 
narrative, which is now occupied with the elfin difficulties 
overcome by the Ouphe in washing away the stain of his wing, and 
re-illuming his flame-wood lamp. His soiled pinion having lost its 
power, he is under the necessity of wending his way on foot from the 
Elfin court upon Cronest to the river beach at its base. His path is 
encumbered at every step with "bog and briar," with "brook and 
mire," with "beds of tangled fern," with "groves of nightshade," and 
with the minor evils of ant and snake. Happily, however, a spotted 
toad coming in sight, our adventurer jumps upon her back, and 
"bridling her mouth with a silkweed twist" bounds merrily along</p>

<p>Here, however, a host of difficulties await him by far too 
multitudinous to enumerate. We will content ourselves with simply 
stating the names of his most respectable assailants. These are the 
"spirits of the waves" dressed in "snail-plate armor" and aided by 
the "mailed shrimp," the "prickly prong," the "blood-red leech," the 
"stony star-fish," the "jellied quarl," the "soldier crab," and the 
"lancing squab." But the hopes of our hero are high, and his limbs 
are strong, so</p>

<p>At length espying a "purple-muscle shell" upon the beach, he 
determines to use it as a boat, and thus evade the animosity of the 
water-spirits whose powers extend not above the wave. Making a 
"sculler's notch" in the stern, and providing himself with an oar of 
the bootle-blade, the Ouphe a second time ventures upon the deep. 
His perils are now diminished, but still great. The imps of the 
river heave the billows up before the prow of the boat, dash the 
surges against her side, and strike against her keel. The quarl 
uprears "his island-back" in her path, and the scallop, floating in 
the rear of the vessel, spatters it all over with water. Our 
adventurer however, bails it out with the colen bell (which he has 
luckily provided for the purpose of catching the drop from the 
silver bow of the sturgeon,) and keeping his little bark warily 
trimmed, holds on his course undiscomfited.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"><small><small>[p. 330]</small></small></a></span>

<p>From this rainbow our Ouphe succeeds in catching, by means of his 
colen-bell cup, a "droplet of the sparkling dew." One half of his 
task is accordingly done&mdash;</p>

<center>His wings are pure, for the gem is won.</center>

<p>On his return to land, the ripples divide before him, while the 
water-spirits, so rancorous before, are obsequiously attentive to 
his comfort. Having tarried a moment on the beach to breathe a 
prayer, he "spreads his wings of gilded blue" and takes his way to 
the elfin court&mdash;there resting until the cricket, at two in the 
morning, rouses him up for the second portion of his penance.</p>

<p>His equipments are now an "acorn helmet," a "thistle-down plume," a 
corslet of the "wild-bee's" skin, a cloak of the "wings of 
butterflies," a shield of the "shell of the lady-bug," for lance 
"the sting of a wasp," for sword a "blade of grass," for horse "a 
fire-fly," and for spurs a couple of "cockle seed." Thus accoutred,</p>

have begun their work&mdash;a "drizzly mist" is cast around him&mdash;"storm,

bridle-rein&mdash;"flame-shot tongues" play around him&mdash;"fiendish eyes"

<p>and the Elfin makes no stop, until he reaches the "bank of the milky 
way." He there checks his courser, and watches "for the glimpse of 
the planet shoot." While thus engaged, however, an unexpected 
adventure befalls him. He is approached by a company of the "sylphs 
of Heaven attired in sunset's crimson pall." They dance around him, 
and "skip before him on the plain." One receiving his "wasp-sting 
lance," and another taking his bridle-rein,</p>

</table>

<p>A glowing description of the queen's beauty follows; and as the form 
of an earthly Fay had never been seen before in the bowers of light, 
she is represented as falling desperately in love at first sight 
with our adventurous Ouphe. He returns the compliment in some 
measure, of course; but, although "his heart bent fitfully," the 
"earthly form imprinted there" was a security against a too vivid 
impression. He declines, consequently, the invitation of the queen 
to remain with her and amuse himself by "lying within the fleecy 
drift," "hanging upon the rainbow's rim," having his "brow adorned 
with all the jewels of the sky," "sitting within the Pleiad ring," 
"resting upon Orion's belt," "riding upon the lightning's gleam," 
"dancing upon the orbed moon," and "swimming within the milky way."</p>

	<tr><td>Lady, he cries, I have sworn to-night<br>
  On the word of a fairy knight<br>

</table>

<p>The queen, therefore, contents herself with bidding the Fay an 
affectionate farewell&mdash;having first directed him carefully to that 
particular portion of the sky where a star is about to fall. He 
reaches this point in safety, and in despite of the "fiends of the 
cloud" who "bellow very loud," succeeds finally in catching a 
"glimmering spark" with which he returns triumphantly to Fairy-land. 
The poem closes with an Io Pæan chaunted by the elves in honor of 
these glorious adventures.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that from among ten readers of the <i>Culprit 
Fay</i>, nine would immediately pronounce it a poem betokening the most 
extraordinary powers of imagination, and of these nine, perhaps five 
or six, poets themselves, and fully impressed with the truth of what 
we have already assumed, that Ideality is indeed the soul of the 
Poetic Sentiment, would feel embarrassed between a 
half-consciousness that they <i>ought</i> to admire the production, and a 
wonder that they <i>do not</i>. This embarrassment would then arise from 
an indistinct conception of the results in which Ideality is 
rendered manifest. Of these results some few are seen in the 
<i>Culprit Fay</i>, but the greater part of it is utterly destitute of 
any evidence of imagination whatever. The general character of the 
poem will, we think, be sufficiently understood by any one who may 
have taken the trouble to read our foregoing compendium of the 
narrative. It will be there seen that what is so frequently termed 
the imaginative power of this story, lies especially&mdash;we should have 
rather said is thought to lie&mdash;in the passages we have quoted, or in 
others of a precisely similar nature. These passages embody, 
principally, mere specifications of qualities, of habiliments, of 
punishments, of occupations, of circumstances &amp;c., which the poet 
has believed in unison with the size, firstly, and secondly with the 
nature of his Fairies. To all which may be added specifications of 
other animal existences (such as the toad, the beetle, the 
lance-fly, the fire-fly and the like) supposed also to be in 
accordance. An example will best illustrate our meaning upon this 
point&mdash;we take it from page 20.</p>

<p>We shall now be understood. Were any of the admirers of the <i>Culprit 
Fay</i> asked their opinion of these lines, they would most probably 
speak in high terms of the <i>imagination</i> they display. Yet let the 
most stolid and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"><small><small>[p. 331]</small></small></a></span>
the most confessedly unpoetical of these 
admirers only try the experiment, and he will find, possibly to his 
extreme surprise, that he himself will have no difficulty whatever 
in substituting for the equipments of the Fairy, as assigned by the 
poet, other equipments equally comfortable, no doubt, and equally in 
unison with the preconceived size, character, and other qualities of 
the equipped. Why we could accoutre him as well ourselves&mdash;let us 
see.</p>

</table>

<p>The truth is, that the only requisite for writing verses of this 
nature, <i>ad libitum</i>, is a tolerable acquaintance with the qualities 
of the objects to be detailed, and a very moderate endowment of the 
faculty of Comparison&mdash;which is the chief constituent of <i>Fancy</i> or 
the powers of combination. A thousand such lines may be composed 
without exercising in the least degree the Poetic Sentiment, which 
is Ideality, Imagination, or the creative ability. And, as we have 
before said, the greater portion of the <i>Culprit Fay</i> is occupied 
with these, or similar things, and upon such, depends very nearly, 
if not altogether, its reputation. We select another example from 
page 25.</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem52">
	<tr><td>But oh! how fair the shape that lay<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And button'd with a sparkling star.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That veils the vestal planet's hue;<br>
  Her eyes, two beamlets from the moon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set floating in the welkin blue.<br>
  Her hair is like the sunny beam,<br>
  And the diamond gems which round it gleam<br>
  Are the pure drops of dewy even,<br>
  That ne'er have left their native heaven.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Here again the faculty of Comparison is alone exercised, and no mind 
possessing the faculty in any ordinary degree would find a 
difficulty in substituting for the materials employed by the poet 
other materials equally as good. But viewed as mere efforts of the 
Fancy and without reference to Ideality, the lines just quoted are 
much worse than those which were taken from page 20. A congruity was 
observable in the accoutrements of the Ouphe, and we had no trouble 
in forming a distinct conception of his appearance when so 
accoutred. But the most vivid powers of Comparison can attach no 
definitive idea to even "the loveliest form of light," when habited 
in a mantle of "rolled purple tied with threads of dawn and buttoned 
with a star," and sitting at the same time under a rainbow with 
"beamlet" eyes and a visage of "lily roon."</p>

<p>But if these things evince no Ideality in their author, do they not 
excite it in others?&mdash;if so, we must conclude, that without being 
himself imbued with the Poetic Sentiment, he has still succeeded in 
writing a fine poem&mdash;a supposition as we have before endeavored to 
show, not altogether paradoxical. Most assuredly we think not. In 
the case of a great majority of readers the only sentiment aroused 
by compositions of this order is a species of vague wonder at the 
writer's <i>ingenuity</i>, and it is this indeterminate sense of wonder 
which passes but too frequently current for the proper influence of 
the Poetic power. For our own parts we plead guilty to a predominant 
sense of the ludicrous while occupied in the perusal of the poem 
before us&mdash;a sense whose promptings we sincerely and honestly 
endeavored to quell, perhaps not altogether successfully, while 
penning our compend of the narrative. That a feeling of this nature 
is utterly at war with the Poetic Sentiment, will not be disputed by 
those who comprehend the character of the sentiment itself. This 
character is finely shadowed out in that popular although vague idea 
so prevalent throughout all time, that a species of melancholy is 
inseparably connected with the higher manifestations of the 
beautiful. But with the numerous and seriously-adduced incongruities 
of the Culprit Fay, we find it generally impossible to connect other 
ideas than those of the ridiculous. We are bidden, in the first 
place, and in a tone of sentiment and language adapted to the 
loftiest breathings of the Muse, to imagine a race of Fairies in the 
vicinity of West Point. We are told, with a grave air, of their 
camp, of their king, and especially of their sentry, who is a 
wood-tick. We are informed that an Ouphe of about an inch in height 
has committed a deadly sin in falling in love with a mortal maiden, 
who may, very possibly, be six feet in her stockings. The 
consequence to the Ouphe is&mdash;what? Why, that he has "dyed his 
wings," "broken his elfin chain," and "quenched his flame-wood 
lamp." And he is therefore sentenced to what? To catch a spark from 
the tail of a falling star, and a drop of water from the belly of a 
sturgeon. What are his equipments for the first adventure? An acorn 
helmet, a thistle-down plume, a butterfly cloak, a lady-bug shield, 
cockle-seed spurs, and a fire-fly horse. How does he ride to the 
second? On the back of a bull-frog. What are his opponents in the 
one? "Drizzly mists," "sulphur and smoke," "shadowy hands" and 
"flame-shot tongues." What in the other? "Mailed shrimps," "prickly 
prongs," "blood-red leeches," "jellied quarls," "stony star fishes," 
"lancing squabs" and "soldier crabs." Is that all? No&mdash;Although only 
an inch high he is in imminent danger of seduction from a "sylphid 
queen," dressed in a mantle of "rolled purple," "tied with threads 
of dawning gold," "buttoned with a sparkling star," and sitting 
under a rainbow with "beamlet eyes" and a countenance of "lily 
roon." In our account of all this matter we have had reference to 
the book&mdash;and to the book alone. It will be difficult to prove us 
guilty in any degree of distortion or exaggeration. Yet such are the 
puerilities we daily find ourselves called upon to admire, as among 
the loftiest efforts of the human mind, and which not to assign a 
rank with the proud trophies of the matured and vigorous genius of 
England, is to prove ourselves at once a fool, a maligner, and no 
patriot.<small><small><sup>7</sup></small></small></p>

<p>In a world where evil is a mere consequence of good, and good a mere 
consequence of evil&mdash;in short where all of which we have any 
conception is good or bad only by comparison&mdash;we have never yet been 
fully able to appreciate the validity of that decision which would 
debar the critic from enforcing upon his readers the merits or 
demerits of a work by placing it in juxta-position with another. It 
seems to us that an adage based in the purest ignorance has had more 
to do with this popular feeling than any just reason founded upon 
common sense. Thinking thus, we shall have no scruple in 
illustrating our opinion in regard to what <i>is not</i> Ideality or the

<blockquote><small><small><sup>8</sup></small> As examples of entire poems of the purest ideality, we 
would cite the <i>Prometheus Vinctus</i> of Æschylus, the <i>Inferno</i> of 
Dante, Cervantes' <i>Destruction of Numantia</i>, the <i>Comus</i> of Milton, 
Pope's <i>Rape of the Lock</i>, Burns' <i>Tam O'Shanter</i>, the <i>Auncient 
Mariner</i>, the <i>Christabel</i>, and the <i>Kubla Khan</i> of Coleridge; and 
most especially the <i>Sensitive Plant</i> of Shelley, and the 
<i>Nightingale</i> of Keats. We have seen American poems evincing the 
faculty in the highest degree.</small></blockquote>

<p>In these exquisite lines the Faculty of mere Comparison is but 
little exercised&mdash;that of Ideality in a wonderful degree. It is 
probable that in a similar case the poet we are now reviewing would 
have formed the face of the Fairy of the "fibrous cloud," her arms 
of the "pale tinge of even," her eyes of the "fair stars," and her 
body of the "twilight shadow." Having so done, his admirers would 
have congratulated him upon his <i>imagination</i>, not taking the 
trouble to think that they themselves could at any moment <i>imagine</i> 
a Fairy of materials equally as good, and conveying an equally 
distinct idea. Their mistake would be precisely analogous to that of 
many a schoolboy who admires the imagination displayed in <i>Jack the 
Giant-Killer</i>, and is finally rejoiced at discovering his own 
imagination to surpass that of the author, since the monsters 
destroyed by Jack are only about forty feet in height, and he 
himself has no trouble in imagining some of one hundred and forty. 
It will be seen that the Fairy of Shelley is not a mere compound of 
incongruous natural objects, inartificially put together, and 
unaccompanied by any <i>moral</i> sentiment&mdash;but a being, in the 
illustration of whose nature some physical elements are used 
collaterally as adjuncts, while the main conception springs 
immediately <i>or thus apparently springs</i>, from the brain of the 
poet, enveloped in the moral sentiments of grace, of color, of 
motion&mdash;of the beautiful, of the mystical, of the august&mdash;in short 
of <i>the ideal</i>.<small><small><sup>9</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>9</sup></small> Among things, which not only in our opinion, but in the 
opinion of far wiser and better men, are to be ranked with the mere 
prettinesses of the Muse, are the positive similes so abundant in 
the writings of antiquity, and so much insisted upon by the critics 
of the reign of Queen Anne.</small></blockquote>

<p>It is by no means our intention to deny that in the <i>Culprit Fay</i> 
are passages of a different order from those to which we have 
objected&mdash;passages evincing a degree of imagination not to be 
discovered in the plot, conception, or general execution of the 
poem. The opening stanza will afford us a tolerable example.</p>

<p>There is Ideality in these lines&mdash;but except in the case of the 
words italicized&mdash;it is Ideality <i>not of a high order</i>. We have it 
is true, a collection of natural 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"><small><small>[p. 333]</small></small></a></span>
objects, each individually of 
great beauty, and, if actually seen as in nature, capable of 
exciting in any mind, through the means of the Poetic Sentiment more 
or less inherent in all, a certain sense of the beautiful. But to 
view such natural objects as they exist, and to behold them through 
the medium of words, are different things. Let us pursue the idea 
that such a collection as we have here will produce, of necessity, 
the Poetic Sentiment, and we may as well make up our minds to 
believe that a catalogue of such expressions as moon, sky, trees, 
rivers, mountains &amp;c., shall be capable of exciting it,&mdash;it is 
merely an extension of the principle. But in the line "the earth is 
dark, <i>but</i> the heavens are bright" besides the simple mention of 
the "dark earth" and the "bright heaven," we have, directly, the 
moral sentiment of the brightness of the sky compensating for the 
darkness of the earth&mdash;and thus, indirectly, of the happiness of a 
future state compensating for the miseries of a present. All this is 
effected by the simple introduction of the word <i>but</i> between the 
"dark heaven" and the "bright earth"&mdash;this introduction, however, 
was prompted by the Poetic Sentiment, and by the Poetic Sentiment 
alone. The case is analogous in the expression "glimmers and dies," 
where the imagination is exalted by the moral sentiment of beauty 
heightened in dissolution.</p>

<p>In one or two shorter passages of the <i>Culprit Fay</i> the poet will 
recognize the purely ideal, and be able at a glance to distinguish 
it from that baser alloy upon which we have descanted. We give them 
without farther comment.</p>

<p>The poem "<i>To a Friend</i>" consists of fourteen Spenserian stanzas. 
They are fine spirited verses, and probably were not supposed by 
their author to be more. Stanza the fourth, although beginning 
nobly, concludes with that very common exemplification of the 
bathos, the illustrating natural objects of beauty or grandeur by 
reference to the tinsel of artificiality.</p>

naturally fallen into the former direction, had the Destroyer only

<p>This poem contains also lines of far greater poetic power than any

<p><i>Niagara</i> is objectionable in many respects, and in none more so

the majestic Niagara replying, "Most assuredly I will roar, whether, 
worm! thou tellest me or not."</p>

<p>Let us reduce all this to plain English, and we have&mdash;what? Why, a

glory," interspersed with "streaks of morning light," relieved with 
a few pieces of "the milky way," and the whole carried by an "eagle 
bearer," that is to say, an eagle ensign, who bears aloft this 
"symbol of our chosen land" in his "mighty hand," by which we are to 
understand his claw. In the second stanza, the "thunder-drum of 
Heaven" is bathetic and grotesque in the highest degree&mdash;a 
commingling of the most sublime music of Heaven with the most 
utterly contemptible and common-place of Earth. The two concluding 
verses are in a better spirit, and might almost be supposed to be 
from a different hand. The images contained in the lines,</p>

<p>The remaining poems in Mr. Dearborn's edition of Drake, are three 
Songs; Lines in an Album; Lines to a Lady; Lines on leaving New 
Rochelle; Hope; A Fragment; To &mdash;&mdash;; Lines; To Eva; To a Lady; To 
Sarah; and Bronx. These are all poems of little compass, and with 
the exception of Bronx and a portion of the Fragment, they have no 
character distinctive from the mass of our current poetical 
literature. Bronx, however, is in our opinion, not only the best of 
the writings of Drake, but altogether a lofty and beautiful poem, 
upon which his admirers would do better to found a hope of the 
writer's ultimate reputation than upon the <i>niaiseries</i> of the 
<i>Culprit Fay</i>. In the <i>Fragment</i> is to be found the finest 
individual passage in the volume before us, and we quote it as a 
proper finale to our Review.</p>

<p>Halleck's poetical powers appear to us essentially inferior, upon 
the whole, to those of his friend Drake. He has written nothing at

of his writings and the very loftiest praise to which he is justly 
entitled.</p>

<p><i>Alnwick Castle</i> is an irregular poem of one hundred and 
twenty-eight lines&mdash;was written, as we are informed, in October 
1822&mdash;and is descriptive of a seat of the Duke of Northumberland, in 
Northumberlandshire, England. The effect of the first stanza is 
materially impaired by a defect in its grammatical arrangement. The 
fine lines,</p>

<p>The objects of allusion here vary, in an awkward manner, from the

<p>The second stanza, without evincing in any measure the loftier

	<tr><td>Gaze on the Abbey's ruined pile:<br>

<p>The commencement of the fourth stanza is of the highest order of 
Poetry, and partakes, in a happy manner, of that quaintness of 
expression so effective an adjunct to Ideality, when employed by the 
Shelleys, the Coleridges and the Tennysons, but so frequently 
debased, and rendered ridiculous, by the herd of brainless 
imitators.</p>

<p>The tone employed in the concluding portions of Alnwick Castle, is, 
we sincerely think, reprehensible, and unworthy of Halleck. No true 
poet can unite in any manner the low burlesque with the ideal, and 
not be conscious of incongruity and of a profanation. Such verses as</p>

</table>

<p>may lay claim to oddity&mdash;but no more. These things are the defects 
and not the beauties of <i>Don Juan</i>. They are totally out of keeping 
with the graceful and delicate manner of the initial portions of 
<i>Alnwick Castle</i>, and serve no better purpose than to deprive the 
entire poem of all unity of effect. If a poet must be farcical, let 
him be just that, and nothing else. To be drolly sentimental is bad 
enough, as we have just seen in certain passages of the <i>Culprit 
Fay</i>, but to be sentimentally droll is a thing intolerable to men, 
and Gods, and columns.</p>

<p><i>Marco Bozzaris</i> appears to have much lyrical without any high order 
of <i>ideal</i> beauty. <i>Force</i> is its prevailing character&mdash;a force, 
however, consisting more in a well ordered and sonorous arrangement 
of the metre, and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"><small><small>[p. 335]</small></small></a></span>
judicious disposal of what may be called 
the circumstances of the poem, than in the true <i>materiel</i> of lyric 
vigor. We are introduced, first, to the Turk who dreams, at 
midnight, in his guarded tent,</p>

  When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should tremble at his power&mdash;</td></tr>

<p>He is represented as revelling in the visions of ambition.</p>

<p>In direct contrast to this we have Bozzaris watchful in the forest, 
and ranging his band of Suliotes on the ground, and amid the 
memories, of Platœa. An hour elapses, and the Turk awakes from his 
visions of false glory&mdash;to die. But Bozzaris dies&mdash;to awake. He dies 
in the flush of victory to awake, in death, to an ultimate certainty 
of Freedom. Then follows an invocation to Death. His terrors under 
ordinary circumstances are contrasted with the glories of the 
dissolution of Bozzaris, in which the approach of the Destroyer is</p>

<p>It will be seen that these arrangements of the subject are skilfully 
contrived&mdash;perhaps they are a little too evident, and we are enabled 
too readily by the perusal of one passage, to anticipate the 
succeeding. The rhythm is highly artificial. The stanzas are well 
adapted for vigorous expression&mdash;the fifth will afford a just 
specimen of the versification of the whole poem.</p>

<p>Granting, however, to <i>Marco Bozzaris</i>, the minor excellences we 
have pointed out, we should be doing our conscience great wrong in 
calling it, upon the whole, any thing more than a very ordinary 
matter. It is surpassed, even as a lyric, by a multitude of foreign 
and by many American compositions of a similar character. To 
Ideality it has few pretensions, and the finest portion of the poem

degree, of the general character observable in the poems of Halleck. 
The <i>Poet's Daughter</i> appears to us a particularly happy specimen of

<p><i>The Lines on the Death of Joseph Rodman Drake</i>, we prefer to any of

<p>As a versifier Halleck is by no means equal to his friend, all of

we are willing to admire in many respects the poems before us, we 
feel obliged to dissent materially from that public opinion (perhaps 
not fairly ascertained) which would assign them a very brilliant 
rank in the empire of Poesy. That we have among us poets of the

<center>SLAVERY.</center>

<p><i>Slavery in the United States. By J. K. Paulding. New York: Harper 
and Brothers.</i></p>

<p><i>The South Vindicated from the Treason and Fanaticism of the 
Northern Abolitionists. Philadelphia: Published by H. Manly.</i></p>

<p>It is impossible to look attentively and understandingly on those 
phenomena that indicate public sentiment in regard to the subject of 
these works, without deep and anxious interest. "<i>Nulla vestigia 
retrorsum</i>," is a saying fearfully applicable to what is called the 
"march of mind." It is unquestionable truth. The absolute and 
palpable impossibility of ever unlearning what we know, and of 
returning, even by forgetfulness, to 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"><small><small>[p. 337]</small></small></a></span> the state of mind in 
which the knowledge of it first found us, has always afforded 
flattering encouragement to the hopes of him who dreams about the 
perfectibility of human nature. Sometimes one scheme, and sometimes 
another is devised for accomplishing this great end; and these means 
are so various, and often so opposite, that the different 
experiments which the world has countenanced would seem to 
contradict the maxim we have quoted. At one time human nature is to 
be elevated to the height of perfection, by emancipating the mind 
from all the restraints imposed by Religion. At another, the same 
end is to be accomplished by the universal spread of a faith, under 
the benign influence of which every son of Adam is to become holy, 
"even as God is holy." One or the other of these schemes has been a 
cardinal point in every system of perfectibility which has been 
devised since the earliest records of man's history began. At the 
same time the progress of knowledge (subject indeed to occasional 
interruptions) has given to each successive experiment a seeming 
advantage over that which preceded it.</p>

<p>But it is lamentable to observe, that let research discover, let 
science teach, let art practice what it may, man, in all his 
mutations, never fails to get back to some point at which he has 
been before. The human mind seems to perform, by some invariable 
laws, a sort of cycle, like those of the heavenly bodies. We may be 
unable, (and, for ourselves, we profess to be so) to trace the 
<i>causes</i> of these changes; but we are not sure that an accurate 
observation of the history of various nations at different times, 
may not detect the <i>laws</i> that govern them. However eccentric the 
orbit, the comet's place in the heavens enables the enlightened 
astronomer to anticipate its future course, to tell when it will 
pass its perihelion, in what direction it will shoot away into the 
unfathomable abyss of infinite space, and at what period it will 
return. But what especially concerns us, is to mark its progress 
through our planetary system, to determine whether in coming or 
returning it may infringe upon us, and prove the messenger of that 
dispensation which, in the end of all things, is to wrap our earth 
in flames.</p>

<p>Not less eccentric, and far more deeply interesting to us, is the 
orbit of the human mind. If, as some have supposed, the comet in its 
upward flight is drawn away by the attraction of some other sun, 
around which also it bends its course, thus linking another system 
with our own, the analogy will be more perfect. For while man is 
ever seen rushing with uncontrollable violence toward one or the 
other of his opposite extremes, fanaticism and irreligion&mdash;at each 
of these we find placed an attractive force identical in its nature 
and in many of its effects. At each extreme, we find him influenced 
by the same prevailing interest&mdash;devoting himself to the 
accomplishment of the same great object. Happiness is his purpose. 
The sources of that, he may be told, are within himself&mdash;but his eye 
will fix on the external means, and these he will labor to obtain. 
Foremost among these, and the equivalent which is to purchase all 
the rest, is property. At this all men aim, and their eagerness 
seems always proportioned to the excitement, which, from whatever 
cause, may for the time prevail. Under such excitement, the many who 
want, band themselves together against the few that possess; and the 
lawless appetite of the multitude for the property of others calls 
itself the spirit of liberty.</p>

<p>In the calm, and, as we would call it, the healthful condition of 
the public mind, when every man worships God after his own manner, 
and Religion and its duties are left to his conscience and his 
Maker, we find each quietly enjoying his own property, and 
permitting to others the quiet enjoyment of theirs. Under that state 
of things, those modes and forms of liberty which regulate and 
secure this enjoyment, are preferred. Peace reigns, the arts 
flourish, science extends her discoveries, and man, and the sources 
of his enjoyments, are multiplied. But in this condition things 
never rest. We have already disclaimed any knowledge of the causes 
which forbid this&mdash;we only know that such exist. We know that men 
are always passing, with fearful rapidity, between the extremes of 
fanaticism and irreligion, and that at either extreme, property and 
all the governmental machinery provided to guard it, become 
insecure. "Down with the Church! Down with the Altar!" is at one 
time the cry. "Turn the fat bigots out of their styes, sell the 
property of the Church and give the money to the poor!" "Behold our 
turn cometh," says the Millenarian. "The kingdoms of this world are 
about to become the kingdoms of God and of his Christ. Sell what you 
have and give to the poor, and let all things be in common!"</p>

<p>It is now about two hundred years since this latter spirit showed 
itself in England with a violence and extravagance which 
accomplished the overthrow of all the institutions of that kingdom. 
With that we have nothing to do; but we should suppose that the 
striking resemblance between the aspect of a certain party in that 
country then and now, could hardly escape the English statesman. 
Fifty years ago, in France, this eccentric comet, "public 
sentiment," was in its opposite node. Making allowance for the 
difference in the characters of the two people, the effects were 
identical, the apparent causes were the opposites of each other. In 
the history of the French Revolution, we find a sort of symptomatic 
phenomenon, the memory of which was soon lost in the fearful 
exacerbation of the disease. But it should be remembered now, that 
in that war against property, the first object of attack was 
property in slaves; that in that war on behalf of the alleged right 
of man to be discharged from all control of law, the first triumph 
achieved was in the emancipation of slaves.</p>

<p>The recent events in the West Indies, and the parallel movement 
here, give an awful importance to these thoughts in our minds. They 
superinduce a something like despair of success in any attempt that 
may be made to resist the attack on all our rights, of which that on 
Domestic Slavery (the basis of all our institutions) is but the 
precursor. It is a sort of boding that may belong to the family of 
superstitions. All vague and undefined fears, from causes the nature 
of which we know not, the operations of which we cannot stay, are of 
that character. Such apprehensions are alarming in proportion to our 
estimate of the value of the interest endangered; and are excited by 
every thing which enhances that estimate. Such apprehensions have 
been awakened in our minds by the books before us. To Mr. Paulding, 
as a Northern man, we tender our grateful thanks for the faithful 
picture he has drawn of slavery as it appeared to him in his visit 
to the South, and as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"><small><small>[p. 338]</small></small></a></span>
exhibited in the information he has 
carefully derived from those most capable of giving it. His work is 
executed in the very happiest manner of an author in whom America 
has the greatest reason to rejoice, and will not fail to enhance his 
reputation immeasurably as a writer of pure and vigorous English, as 
a clear thinker, as a patriot, and as a man. The other publication, 
which we take to be from a Southern pen, is more calculated to 
excite our indignation against the calumnies which have been put 
forth against us, and the wrongs meditated by those who come to us 
in the names of our common Redeemer and common country&mdash;seeking our 
destruction under the mask of Christian Charity and Brotherly Love. 
This too is executed with much ability, and may be read with 
pleasure as well as profit. While we take great pleasure in 
recommending these works to our readers, we beg leave to add a few 
words of our own. We are the more desirous to do this, because there 
is a view of the subject most deeply interesting to us, which we do 
not think has ever been presented, by any writer, in as high relief 
as it deserves. We speak of the moral influences flowing from the 
relation of master and slave, and the moral feelings engendered and 
cultivated by it. A correspondent of Mr. Paulding's justly speaks of 
this relation as one partaking of the patriarchal character, and 
much resembling that of clanship. This is certainly so. But to say 
this, is to give a very inadequate idea of it, unless we take into 
consideration the peculiar character (I may say the peculiar nature) 
of the negro. Let us reason upon it as we may, there is certainly a 
power, in causes inscrutable to us, which works essential changes in 
the different races of animals. In their physical constitution this 
is obvious to the senses. The color of the negro no man can deny, 
and therefore, it was but the other day, that they who will believe 
nothing they cannot account for, made this manifest fact an 
authority for denying the truth of holy writ. Then comes the 
opposite extreme&mdash;they are, like ourselves, the sons of Adam, and 
must therefore, have like passions and wants and feelings and 
tempers in all respects. This, we deny, and appeal to the knowledge 
of all who know. But their authority will be disputed, and their 
testimony falsified, unless we can devise something to show how a 
difference might and should have been brought about. Our theory is a 
short one. It was the will of God it should be so. But the 
means&mdash;how was this effected? We will give the answer to any one who 
will develop the causes which might and should have blackened the 
negro's skin and crisped his hair into wool. Until that is done, we 
shall take leave to speak, as of things <i>in esse</i>, of a degree of 
loyal devotion on the part of the slave to which the white man's 
heart is a stranger, and of the master's reciprocal feeling of 
parental attachment to his humble dependant, equally 
incomprehensible to him who drives a bargain with the cook who 
prepares his food, the servant who waits at his table, and the nurse 
who doses over his sick bed. That these sentiments in the breast of 
the negro and his master, are stronger than they would be under like 
circumstances between individuals of the white race, we believe. 
That they belong to the class of feelings "by which the heart is 
made better," we know. How come they? They have their rise in the 
relation between the infant and the nurse. They are cultivated 
between him and his foster brother. They are cherished by the 
parents of both. They are fostered by the habit of affording 
protection and favors to the younger offspring of the same nurse. 
They grow by the habitual use of the word "my," used as the language 
of affectionate appropriation, long before any idea of value mixes 
with it. It is a term of endearment. That is an easy transition by 
which he who is taught to call the little negro "his," in this sense 
and <i>because he loves him</i>, shall love him <i>because he is his</i>. The 
idea is not new, that our habits and affections are reciprocally 
cause and effect of each other.</p>

<p>But the great teacher in this school of feeling is sickness. In this 
school we have witnessed scenes at which even the hard heart of a 
thorough bred philanthropist would melt. But here, we shall be told, 
it is not humanity, but interest that prompts. Be it so. Our 
business is not with the cause but the effect. But is it interest, 
which, with assiduous care, prolongs the life of the aged and 
decrepid negro, who has been, for years, a burthen? Is it interest 
which labors to rear the crippled or deformed urchin, who can never 
be any thing but a burthen&mdash;which carefully feeds the feeble lamp of 
life that, without any appearance of neglect, might be permitted to 
expire? Is not the feeling more akin to that parental στοργη, which, 
in defiance of reason, is most careful of the life 
which is, all the time, felt to be a curse to the possessor. Are 
such cases rare? They are as rare as the occasions; but let the 
occasion occur, and you will see the case. How else is the longevity 
of the negro proverbial? A negro who does no work for thirty years! 
(and we know such examples) is it interest which has lengthened out 
his existence?</p>

<p>Let the philanthropist think as he may&mdash;by the negro himself, his 
master's care of him in sickness is not imputed to interested 
feelings. We know an instance of a negress who was invited by a 
benevolent lady in Philadelphia to leave her mistress. The lady 
promised to secrete her for a while, and then to pay her good wages. 
The poor creature felt the temptation and was about to yield. "You 
are mighty good, madam," said she "and I am a thousand times obliged 
to you. And if I am sick, or any thing, I am sure you will take care 
of me, and nurse me, like my good mistress used to do, and bring me 
something warm and good to comfort me, and tie up my head and fix my 
pillow." She spoke in the simplicity of her heart, and the tempter 
had not the heart to deceive her. "No," said she "all <i>that</i> will 
come out of your wages&mdash;for you will have money enough to hire a 
nurse." The tears had already swelled into the warm hearted 
creature's eyes, at her own recital of her mistress's kindness. They 
now gushed forth in a flood, and running to her lady who was a 
lodger in the house, she threw herself on her knees, confessed her 
fault, was pardoned, and was happy.</p>

<p>But it is not by the bedside of the sick negro that the feeling we 
speak of is chiefly engendered. They who would view it in its causes 
and effects must see him by the sick bed of his master&mdash;must see 
<i>her</i> by the sick bed of her <i>mistress</i>. We have seen these things. 
We have seen the dying infant in the lap of its nurse, and have 
stood with the same nurse by the bed side of her own dying child. 
Did mighty nature assert her empire, and wring from the mother's 
heart more and bitterer tears than she had shed over her foster 
babe? None that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"><small><small>[p. 339]</small></small></a></span>
the eye of man could distinguish. And he who 
sees the heart&mdash;did he see dissimulation giving energy to the 
choking sobs that <i>seemed</i> to be rendered more vehement by her 
attempts to repress them? <i>Philanthropy</i> may think so if it pleases.</p>

<p>A good lady was on her death bed. Her illness was long and 
protracted, but hopeless from the first. A servant, (by no means a 
favorite with her, being high tempered and ungovernable) was 
advanced in pregnancy, and in bad health. Yet she could not be kept 
out of the house. She was permitted to stay about her mistress 
during the day, but sent to bed at an early hour every night. Her 
reluctance to obey was obvious, and her master found that she evaded 
his order, whenever she could escape his eye. He once found her in 
the house late at night, and kindly reproving her, sent her home. An 
hour after, suddenly going out of the sick room, he stumbled over 
her in the dark. She was crouched down at the door, listening for 
the groans of the sufferer. She was again ordered home, and turned 
to go. Suddenly she stopped, and bursting into tears, said, "Master 
it aint no use for me to go to bed, Sir. It don't do me no good, I 
cannot sleep, Sir."</p>

<p>Such instances prove that in reasoning concerning the moral effect 
of slavery, he who regards man as a unit, the same under all 
circumstances, leaves out of view an important consideration. The 
fact that he is not so, is manifest to every body&mdash;but the 
application of the fact to this controversy is not made. The author 
of "The South Vindicated" quotes at page 228, a passage from 
Lamartine, on this very point, though he only uses it to show the 
absurdity of any attempt at amalgamation. The passage is so apt to 
our purpose that we beg leave to insert it.</p>

<blockquote><small>The more I have travelled, the more I am convinced <i>that the races 
of men form the great secret of history and manners</i>. Man is not so 
capable of education as philosophers imagine. The influence of 
governments and laws has less power, radically, than is supposed, 
over the manners and instincts of any people, while the primitive 
constitution and the blood of the race have always their influence, 
and manifest themselves, thousands of years afterwards, in the 
physical formations and moral habits of a particular family or 
tribe. Human nature flows in rivers and streams into the vast ocean 
of humanity; but its waters mingle but slowly, sometimes never; and 
it emerges again, like the Rhone from the Lake of Geneva, with its 
own taste and color. Here is indeed an abyss of thought and 
meditation, and at the same time a grand secret for legislators. As 
long as they keep the spirit of the race in view they succeed; but 
they fail when they strive against this natural predisposition: 
nature is stronger than they are. This sentiment is not that of the 
philosophers of the present time, but it is evident to the 
traveller; and there is more philosophy to be found in a caravan 
journey of a hundred leagues, than in ten years' reading and 
meditation.</small></blockquote>

<p>There is much truth here, though certainly not what passes for truth 
with those who study human nature wholly in the closet, and in 
reforming the world address themselves exclusively to the faults of 
<i>others</i>, and the evils of which they know the least, and which 
least concern themselves.</p>

<p>We hope the day has gone by when we are to be judged by the 
testimony of false, interested, and malignant accusers alone. We 
repeat that we are thankful to Mr. Paulding for having stepped 
forward in our defence. Our assailants arc numerous, and it is 
indispensable that we should meet the assault with vigor and 
activity. Nothing is wanting but manly discussion to convince our 
own people at least, that in continuing to command the services of 
their slaves, they violate no law divine or human, and that in the 
faithful discharge of their reciprocal obligations lies their true 
duty. Let these be performed, and we believe (with our esteemed 
correspondent Professor Dew) that society in the South will derive 
much more of good than of evil from this much abused and 
partially-considered institution.</p>

<center>BRUNNENS OF NASSAU.</center>

<p><i>Bubbles from the Brunnens of Nassau. By an Old Man. New York: 
Harper and Brothers.</i></p>

<p>This "old man" is the present Governor of Canada, and a very amusing 
"old man" is he. A review of his work, which appeared a year ago in 
the North American, first incited us to read it, a pleasure which 
necessity has compelled us to forego until the present time&mdash;there 
not having been an American edition put to press until now, and the 
splendid hot-pressed, calf-bound, gilt-edged edition from 
Albemarle-street being too costly for very general circulation here.</p>

<p>The "bubbles" are blown into being by a gentleman who represents 
himself as having been sentenced, in the cold evening of his life, 
to drink the mineral waters of Nassau; and who, upon arriving at the 
springs, found that, in order to effect the cure designed by his 
physicians, the mind was to be relaxed as the body was being 
strengthened. The result of this regimen was the production of "The 
Bubbles," or hasty sketches of whatever chanced for the moment to 
please either the eyes or the mind of the patient. He anticipates 
the critic's verdict as to his book&mdash;that it is empty, light, vain, 
hollow and superficial: "but then," says he, "it is the nature of 
'bubbles' to be so."</p>

<p>He describes his voyage from the Custom House Stairs in the Thames, 
by steamboat to Rotterdam, and thence his journey to the Nassau 
springs of <i>Langen-Schwalbach</i>, <i>Schlangen-bad</i>, <i>Nieder-selters</i>, 
and <i>Wiesbaden</i>. Here he spends a season, bathing and drinking the 
waters of those celebrated springs, and describing such incidents as 
occurred to relieve the monotony of his somewhat idle life, in a 
most agreeable and <i>taking</i> way. To call this work facetious, as 
that term is commonly used, were not perhaps to give so accurate an 
idea of its style as might be conveyed by the adjective whimsical. 
Without subjecting the "old man" to the imputation of <i>copyism</i>, one 
may describe the manner as being an agreeable mixture of <i>Charles 
Lamb's</i> and <i>Washington Irving's</i>. The same covert conceit, the same 
hidden humor, the same piquant allusion, which, while you read, 
place the author bodily before you, a quiet old gentleman fond of 
his ease, but fonder of his joke&mdash;not a broad, forced, loud, 
vacant-minded joke, but a quiet, pungent, sly, laughter-moving 
conceit, which, at first stirring the finest membranes of your 
<i>pericardium</i>, at length sets you out into a broad roar of laughter, 
honest fellow as you are, and which you must be, indeed, a very 
savage, if you can avoid.</p>

<p>Our bubble-blower observes everything within the sphere of his 
vision, and even makes a most amusing chapter out of "The 
schwein-general," or pig-drover of Schlangen-bad, which we wish we 
had space for entire. As it is, we give some reflections upon "the 
pig," <span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"><small><small>[p. 340]</small></small></a></span>
as being perfectly characteristic of the author's 
peculiar style.</p>

<blockquote><small>There exists perhaps in creation no animal which has less justice 
and more injustice done to him by man than the pig. Gifted with 
every faculty of supplying himself, and of providing even against 
the approaching storm, which no creature is better capable of 
foretelling than a pig, we begin by putting an iron ring through the 
cartilage of his nose, and having thus barbarously deprived him of 
the power of searching for, and analyzing his food, we generally 
condemn him for the rest of his life to solitary confinement in a 
sty.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>While his faculties are still his own, only observe how, with a bark 
or snort, he starts if you approach him, and mark what shrewd 
intelligence there is in his bright, twinkling little eye; but with 
pigs, as with mankind, idleness is the root of all evil. The poor 
animal, finding that he has absolutely nothing to do&mdash;having no 
enjoyment&mdash;nothing to look forward to but the pail which feeds him, 
naturally most eagerly, or as we accuse him, most greedily, greets 
its arrival. Having no natural business or diversion&mdash;nothing to 
occupy his brain&mdash;the whole powers of his system are directed to the 
digestion of a superabundance of food. To encourage this, nature 
assists him with sleep, which lulling his better faculties, leads 
his stomach to become the ruling power of his system&mdash;a tyrant that 
can bear no one's presence but his own. The poor pig, thus treated, 
gorges himself&mdash;sleeps&mdash;eats again&mdash;sleeps&mdash;wakens in a 
fright&mdash;screams&mdash;struggles against the blue apron&mdash;screams fainter 
and fainter&mdash;turns up the whites of his little eyes&mdash;and&mdash;dies!</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>It is probably from abhorring this picture, that I know of nothing 
which is more distressing to me than to witness an indolent man 
eating his own home-fed pork.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>There is something so horribly similar between the life of the human 
being and that of his victim&mdash;their notions on all subjects are so 
unnaturally contracted&mdash;there is such a melancholy resemblance 
between the strutting residence in the village, and the stalking 
confinement in the sty&mdash;between the sound of the dinner-bell and the 
rattling of the pail&mdash;between snoring in an armchair and grunting in 
clean straw&mdash;that, when I contrast the "pig's countenance" in the 
dish with that of his lord and master, who, with outstretched 
elbows, sits leaning over it, I own I always feel it is so hard the 
one should have killed the other.&mdash;In short there is a sort of "Tu 
quoque, B<small>RUTE</small>!" moral in the picture, which to my mind is most 
painfully distressing.</small></blockquote>

<p>The author thus speaks in relation to the mineral water of 
Wiesbaden.</p>

<blockquote><small>In describing the taste of the mineral water of Wiesbaden, were I to 
say, that while drinking it, one hears in one's ears the cackling of 
hens, and that one sees feathers flying before one's eyes, I should 
certainly grossly exaggerate; but when I declare that it exactly 
resembles very hot chicken-broth, I only say what Dr. Granville 
said, and what in fact everybody says, and must say, respecting it; 
and certainly I do wonder why the common people should be at the 
inconvenience of making bad soup, when they can get much better from 
nature's great stock pot&mdash;the Koch-brunnen of Wiesbaden. At all 
periods of the year, summer or winter, the temperature of this broth 
remains the same, and when one reflects that it has been bubbling 
out of the ground, and boiling over in the same state, certainly 
from the time of the Romans, and probably from the time of the 
flood, it is really astonishing to think what a most wonderful 
apparatus there must exist below, what an inexhaustible stock of 
provisions to ensure such an everlasting supply of broth, always 
formed of exactly the same degree, and always served up at exactly 
the same heat.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>One would think that some of the particles in the recipe would be 
exhausted; in short, to speak metaphorically, that the chickens 
would at last be boiled to rags, or that the fire would go out for 
want of coals; but the oftener one reflects on these sort of 
subjects, the oftener is the old-fashioned observation repeated, 
that let a man go where he will, Omnipotence is never from his view.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>It is good they say for the stomach&mdash;good for the skin&mdash;good for 
ladies of all possible ages&mdash;for all sorts and conditions of men. 
For a headache, drink, the inn-keepers exclaim, at the Koch-brunnen. 
For gout in the heels, soak the body, the doctors say, in the 
chicken-broth!&mdash;in short, the valetudinarian, reclining in his 
carriage, has scarcely entered the town, say what he will of 
himself, the inhabitants all seem to agree in repeating&mdash;"<i>Bene bene 
respondere, dignus est intrare nostro docto corpore!</i>"</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>There was something to my mind so very novel in bathing in broth, 
that I resolved to try the experiment, particularly as it was the 
only means I had of following the crowd. Accordingly, retiring to my 
room, in a minute or two I also, in my slippers and black 
dressing-gown was to be seen, staff in hand, mournfully walking down 
the long passage, as slowly and as gravely as if I had been in such 
a profession all my life. An infirm elderly lady was just before 
me&mdash;some lighter-sounding footsteps were behind me&mdash;but without 
raising our eyes from the ground, we all moved on, just as if we had 
been corpses gliding or migrating from one church yard to another.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The door was now closed, and my dressing-gown being carefully hung 
upon a peg, (a situation I much envied it,) I proceeded, 
considerably against my inclination, to introduce myself to my new 
acquaintance, whose face, or surface, was certainly very revolting; 
for a white, thick, dirty, greasy scum, exactly resembling what 
would be on broth, covered the top of the bath. But all this, they 
say is exactly as it should be; and indeed, German bathers at 
Wiesbaden actually insist on its appearance, as it proves, they 
argue, that the bath has not been used by any one else. In most 
places in ordering a warm bath, it is necessary to wait till the 
water be heated, but at Wiesbaden, the springs are so exceedingly 
hot, that the baths are obliged to be filled over night, in order to 
be cool enough in the morning; and the dirty scum I have mentioned 
is the required proof that the water has, during that time, been 
undisturbed.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>Resolving not to be bullied by the ugly face of my antagonist, I 
entered my bath, and in a few seconds I lay horizontally, calmly 
soaking, like my neighbors.</small></blockquote>

<p>Here is a characteristic <i>crayoning:</i></p>

<blockquote><small>As soon as breakfast was over, I generally enjoyed the luxury of 
idling about the town: and, in passing the shop of a blacksmith, who 
lived opposite to the Goldene Kette, the manner in which he tackled 
and shod a vicious horse amused me. On the outside wall of the house 
two rings were firmly fixed, to one of which the head of the patient 
was lashed close to the ground; the hind foot, to be shod, stretched 
out to the utmost extent of the leg, was then secured to the other 
ring about five feet high, by a cord which passed through a cloven 
hitch, fixed to the root of the poor creature's tail.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The hind foot was consequently very much higher than the head; 
indeed, it was so exalted, and pulled so heavily at the tail, that 
the animal seemed to be quite anxious to keep his other feet on 
<i>terra firma</i>. With one hoof in the heavens, it did not suit him to 
kick; with his nose pointing to the infernal regions, he could not 
conveniently rear, and as the devil himself was apparently pulling 
at his tail, the horse at last gave up the point, and quietly 
submitted to be shod.</small></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Fay wishes us to believe that the sale of a book is the proper 
test of its merit. To save time and trouble we <i>will</i> believe it, 
and are prepared to acknowledge, as a consequence of the theory, 
that the novel of Norman Leslie is not at all comparable to the 
Memoirs of Davy Crockett, or the popular lyric of Jim Crow.</p>

<h4>SUPPLEMENT.</h4>
<br>
<p>At the solicitation of our correspondents, we again publish some few 
of the <i>Notices of the Messenger</i>, which have lately appeared in the 
papers of the day. The supplement now printed contains probably 
about one fifth of the flattering evidences of public favor which 
have reached us, from all quarters, within a few weeks. Those 
selected are a fair sample of the general character of the whole.</p>
<br>

<center><small>From the Charlottesville Advocate.</small></center>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;We have been favored by Mr. 
White, the proprietor, with the March No. of this periodical. The 
delay in the publication has been occasioned by the desire of Mr. 
White to insert Prof. Dew's Address. However desirable a regular and 
punctual issue may be, we are disposed to excuse the delay on the 
present occasion, for the reason assigned.</p>

<p>As the Messenger has now passed through the difficulties attendant 
on new enterprises, is on a permanent footing, and has vindicated 
its claims to rank among the first of American Periodicals, we 
commenced the perusal of the present number, predetermined to 
censure whenever we could get the slightest pretext. We have read it 
calmly and with a "critic's eye," and though it is not faultless, 
for with two exceptions the poetry is below mediocrity, we have been 
so delighted with most of the articles, as not to have the heart to 
censure. We candidly regard it the best single number of any 
American periodical we have ever seen. Mr. Dew's Address and Mr. 
Stanton's Essay on Manual Labor Schools, are articles of enduring 
and inestimable worth.</p>

<p>We subjoin the following notice of the contents from the Richmond 
Compiler, with which we in the main concur.</p>

<center><small>From the Richmond Compiler.</small></center>

<blockquote><small>We have already announced the appearance of the Literary Messenger 
for March 1836. We always read the work with pleasure, and have 
frequently awarded to it the high praise it so well deserves. In the 
present instance, we are forcible struck with a sort of merit so 
rare in publications of the kind, that, to a certain class of 
readers, our praise may sound like censure.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>We hazard nothing in saying, that in the pages before us, there is 
more substantial matter, more information, more food for the mind, 
and more provocative to thought, than we have ever seen in any 
periodical of a miscellaneous character. A chapter from Lionel 
Granby&mdash;a <i>jeu d'esprit</i> from Mr. Poe&mdash;some of the reviews&mdash;and a 
page or two of description&mdash;together with a very few metrical 
lines&mdash;make the sum total of light reading.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>We would not be understood to mean that the rest is heavy. Far from 
it. But we want some word to distinguish that which ought to be read 
and studied, from that which may be read for amusement only. He who 
shall read the rest of the number, must be very careless or very 
dull, if he is not edified and instructed. We will add, that his 
taste must be bad, if he is not tempted to receive the instruction 
here offered by the graces of style, the originality of thought, and 
the felicity of illustration, with which the gravest of these 
articles abounds.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>This remark applies in all its force to Professor Dew's Address, 
which all who cherish a well-balanced love, at once for the 
Sovereignty and the Union of these States, will read with delight. 
Those who have yet to acquire this sentiment, will read it with 
profit. If there be any man who doubts the peculiar advantages, 
moral, intellectual and pecuniary of a system of federative harmony, 
contradistinguished from consolidation on the one hand, and disunion 
on the other, let him read, and doubt no more.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>A subject of less vivid interest has been treated in a style at once 
amusing and instructive, by the author of the Essay on the Classics. 
No one can read that essay, without feeling that there must be 
something to refine and sublime the mind of man in the studies in 
which the writer is so obviously a proficient. Are these the 
thoughts? are these the images and illustrations? is this the 
language, with which the study of the classics makes a man familiar? 
Then it is true, as the poet has said:</small></blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros."</small></td></tr>
</table>

<blockquote><small>"<i>Mutatis mutandis</i>," we would award the same general praise to an 
Essay on Education, and to the addresses from Judge Tucker of the 
Court of Appeals, and Mr. Maxwell of Norfolk. As to the continuation 
of the Sketches of African History, it is enough to say that it is a 
continuation worthy of what has gone before.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The reviews are, as usual, piquant and lively, and in that style 
which will teach writers to value the praise and dread the censures 
of the critic. Among the articles reviewed, we are pleased at the 
appearance of Dr. Hawk's historical work. We are delighted, too, to 
find him, though not a Virginian, coming to the rescue of Virginia, 
from the misjudged or disingenuous praises of men who knew not how 
to appreciate the character of our ancestors. No. <i>It is a new thing 
with Virginians to lean to the side of power.</i> Those who have taught 
her that lesson, have found her an unapt scholar. The spirit of 
Virginia tends <i>upwards</i>, and we have all seen</small></blockquote>

<center><small>"With what compulsion, and laborious flight,"</small></center>

<blockquote><small>she has sunk to her present degraded condition.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>To think of our fathers, as they stood 180 years ago, yielding with 
undisguised reluctance to inevitable necessity; and, in the very act 
of <i>submission</i> to the <i>power</i> of the usurper, denying his <i>right</i>,

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>, for March, is just out: late in 
the day, it is true, but not any the less acceptable on that 
account. We have just risen from a faithful perusal of its contents, 
which are of uncommon richness and value. Its merits are solid, not 
superficial: and therein it is more worthy of the support of the 
lovers of literature, than any other literary Magazine published in 
our country. We mean what we say, disdainful of the imputation of 
being thought capable of a puff. It is a repository of works "to 
keep," and not of the trash which "perisheth in the using." Still it 
has variety. It combines the <i>utile et dulce</i> in a most attractive 
and pleasing degree, and there is no lack of that "change" of which 
the poet says the "mind of desultory man" is "studious."</p>

<p>We will give the readers of the Patriot a bird's eye view of the 
contents of the number we have just laid down, in illustration and 
corroboration of what we have said in relation to its merits.</p>

<p><i>Sketches of Tripoli, No. XI.</i>&mdash;One may gather a very good idea of 
the present condition of the Barbary States, from a perusal of these 
graphic papers. We know no others extant so attractive and so 
satisfactory. They are written in a pure and refined style, and form 
a very valuable and interesting history.</p>

<p>"<i>The Classics</i>" is the title of one of the most splendid articles 
we have ever perused in any shape. This one paper would be cheaply 
purchased by the scholar, at the subscription fee for the volume. It 
is a defence of the Classics and a classical education, against the 
modern innovations of the romantic school. The writer makes out his 
case most ably and convincingly,&mdash;showing himself to be well fitted 
for the task he assumed, by the devotedness with which he has 
worshipped at the pure shrine to which he would win his readers. We 
wish we were sure that we had said enough to draw a general 
attention to this admirable article.</p>

<p><i>A Loan to the Messenger</i>, including <i>Life</i>, a Brief History, 
in three parts, with a sequel, by C<small>UTTER</small>, is not only "exceedingly 
neat," but surpassingly beautiful. It is a rare instance of the 
union of tender sentiment and epigrammatic point. For example&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Readings with my Pencil</i>, No. III, a most excellent article&mdash;full 
of poetical thoughts and, generally speaking, profound ones. We 
agree with J. F. O. cordially, in his opinion of <i>Burns</i>, in the 
case "<i>Burns vs. Moore</i>." Yet there are not many who will so agree 
with him. <i>Reading No. 12</i>, is more regardful of words than things. 
Dr. Johnson was right, we think, in saying that "the suspicion of 
Swift's irreligion proceeded, in a great measure, from his dread of 
hypocrisy," and J. F. O. is wrong in therefore concluding that 
"Swift, according to Johnson, was afraid of being thought a 
hypocrite and so actually became one." But of this J. F. O. was well 
aware&mdash;he could not think, however of sacrificing the antithesis. 
Let him examine the word <i>hypocrisy</i> and ascertain its <i>popular</i> 
meaning, for thereby hangs the tale. A man who feigns a character 
which he does not possess, is not necessarily a hypocrite. The 
<i>popular</i> acceptation of hypocrisy requires that being vicious, he 
shall feign virtue. This the very intelligent author of <i>Readings 
with My Pencil</i> will not fail to perceive at once. These readings 
are far better than nine-tenths of the <i>fudge</i> of <i>Lacon</i>&mdash;or the 
purer <i>fudge</i> of <i>Rochefoucault</i>.</p>

<p><i>Halley's Comet</i>.&mdash;After Miss Draper's stanzas thus entitled, the 
poet of "Prince Edward" should not have sent his to the Messenger. 
We cannot call this poetry or philosophy,&mdash;it was not intended 
obviously as burlesque.</p>

	<tr><td>Art thou the ship of heaven, laden with light,<br>

</table>

<p><i>Epimanes</i>.&mdash;This is one of Poe's queerities. He takes the reader 
back in supposition to the city of Antioch, in the year of the world 
3830, and in that peculiar style, which after all must be called 
<i>Poe-tical</i>, because it is just that and nothing else, he feigns the 
enactment of a real scene of the times before your eyes. The actors 
"come like shadows, so depart,"&mdash;but yet assume a most vivid reality 
while they stay. We hope this powerful pen will be again similarly 
employed.</p>

<p>"<i>To Helen</i>" is a pretty little gem, and from the same mine. It 
shall glisten in the Patriot ere long.</p>

<p>In the <i>Poetry of Burns</i>, by J<small>AMES</small> F. O<small>TIS</small>, we see much of the fine 
lyrical feeling which distinguishes the "<i>Readings with My Pencil</i>." 
The subject, to be sure, is <i>au peu passe</i>&mdash;but we can hardly have 
too much of B<small>URNS</small>. Mr. O<small>TIS</small> seems fully to understand and appreciate 
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Change</i>"&mdash;pretty verses, but not poetry. The four last lines 
should always be at least <i>as good</i> as the rest. One judges of the 
flavor of a fruit by the taste it <i>leaves</i> in the mouth. Apply this 
hint to these verses.</p>

<p>The next paper is an Address delivered before the Literary Institute 
at Hampden Sidney College by Mr. S<small>TANTON</small>, upon the importance of 
"<i>Manual Labor Schools</i>," as connected with literary institutions. 
It is an admirable production; and one of that class of papers which 
go to make the "Messenger" what we have already designated it, the 
only Literary Magazine now set up in this country deserving the 
name.</p>

<p>An interesting description of a Natural Bridge in South America, 
that the writer thinks more sublime than that in Virginia (which we 
can hardly credit)&mdash;some dozen lines about Washington, good only for 
filling in the spare nook they occupy, and an epigram without point, 
next follow, and these are succeeded by another South American 
sketch, describing a waterfall, of great beauty.</p>

<p>We cannot say much in favor of the "<i>Song of Lee's Legion</i>," nor 
will we say much against it. We wish the poetry of the Messenger 
were of a higher order. At present it does not hold equality with 
the prose department, by any means.</p>

<p>"<i>Lionel Granby</i>" is written with much spirit, and the present (the 
eleventh) chapter is one of the best. We will review this whole 
story, at length, when completed. We think it equal to any of the 
novellettes which it has now become so fashionable to publish in 
this form: although that form, so full of interruptions as it is, 
prevents that enjoyment in perusal which would be derived from the 
possession of the work entire.</p>

<p>"<i>The Patriarch's Inheritance</i>."&mdash;Rich language, fine conception, 
smooth versification. "T. H. S." improves.</p>

<p><i>Americanisms:</i> Captions.&mdash;We are too apt to bark before we are 
bitten; and there was no especial need that "H." should growl at 
B<small>ULWER</small>, because he had made a very good terse word to express 
<i>greedy</i>, from the Latin <i>avidus</i>, merely by way of vindicating our 
people from old charges of a similar character.</p>

<p>Stanzas <i>To Randolph of Roanoke</i>, written soon after his death. We 
cannot say that Hesperus has done enough in this effusion to induce 
us to alter our verdict upon the poetry of the Messenger. As the 
stanzas appear to be a matter of feeling with the author, we will 
not enter into a discussion of the sentiments they contain. We would 
advise him to try another kind of theme.</p>

<p><i>Address</i>, by the Hon. H<small>ENRY</small> S<small>T</small>. 
G<small>EORGE</small> T<small>UCKER</small>, before the Virginia 
Historical and Philosophical Society&mdash;a most admirable paper. It was 
delivered upon the distinguished author's taking the seat vacated by 
the late Chief Justice M<small>ARSHALL</small>, as President of the above named 
Society; and is, mostly, a beautiful eulogy upon his illustrious 
predecessor. It is just such a production as our knowledge of the 
author would have led us to anticipate from him&mdash;alike creditable to 
his head, stored with the lore of ages, and to his heart, full of 
the kindest and most benevolent feelings.</p>

<p>Mr. M<small>AXWELL'S</small> Speech, before the Virginia Historical and 
Philosophical Society, at its late annual meeting, another eloquent 
eulogy upon the lamented M<small>ARSHALL</small>. Virginia seems to be taking the 
most serene delight in wreathing garlands around his tomb, and this 
is one of the most verdant, and promises to be one of the most 
enduring. It is short, but breathes eloquently forth a spirit which 
will impress it upon the minds and memories of hearers and readers. 
It is a high compliment to the M<small>ESSENGER</small>, and a pregnant proof of 
the estimation into which that journal has worthily grown that it is 
made the medium of conveying such productions to posterity.</p>

<p>But the most valuable paper in the number is an Address on the 
influence of the Federative Republican System of Government upon 
Literature, and the Development of Character, by Professor Dew. We 
have never perused a more able literary essay than this address. The 
author traverses the whole field of literature, and draws from the 
stores of antiquity lessons for the improvement of his own 
countrymen in literature, art, and politics. We commend it to the 
perusal of every American.</p>

<p>Then follow "<i>Critical Notices</i>." These are written by P<small>OE</small>. They are 
few and clever. The sledge-hammer and scimetar are laid aside, and 
not one poor devil of an author is touched, except one "Mahmoud," 
who is let off with a box on the ear for plagiarism. The review of 
"Georgia Scenes" has determined us to buy the book. The extracts are 
irresistible.</p>

<p>The merit of this number consists in its solidity. The same amount 
of reading, of a similar character, can certainly no where and in no 
other form be furnished the reader on the same terms. It is our duty 
no less than our interest to sustain 'the Messenger.'</p>

<p><i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;No. 4, Vol. 2, of this Journal is 
just issued, and contains 16 pages of matter over and above its 
usual quantity&mdash;that is, it contains 80 closely printed pages in 
place of 64, its promised amount. A very slight inspection will 
convince any one at all conversant in these matters that the present 
number of the Messenger embraces as much reading matter (if not 
considerably more) than four ordinary volumes, such for example, as 
the volumes of Paul Ulric or Norman Leslie. Of the value of the 
matter, or rather of its value in comparison with such ephemera as 
these just mentioned, it is of course unnecessary to say much. 
Popular opinion has placed the Messenger in a very enviable position 
as regards the Literature of the South. We have no hesitation in 
saying that it has elevated it immeasurably. To use the words of a 
Northern contemporary "it has done more within the last six months 
to refine the literary standard in this country than has been 
accomplished before in the space of ten years."</p>

<p>The number before us commences with No. XI. (continued) of the 
<i>Tripolitan Sketches</i>. We can add nothing to the public voice in 
favor of this series of papers. They are excellent&mdash;and the one for 
this month is equal to any in point of interest.</p>

<p><i>The Classics</i> is a most admirable paper&mdash;indeed one of the most 
forcible, and strange to say, one of the most original defences of 
Ancient Literature we have ever perused. We do not, however, 
altogether like the sneers at Bulwer in the beginning of the 
article. They should have been omitted, for they are not only 
unjust, but they make against the opinions advanced. Bulwer is not 
only a ripe scholar, but an advocate of classical acquirement.</p>

<p><i>A Loan to the Messenger</i>, is beautiful&mdash;very beautiful&mdash;witness the

<p><i>Readings with My Pencil, No. 2.</i> is a fine article in the manner of 
Colton. A true sentiment well expressed is contained in the 
concluding words: "I am one of those who are best when most 
afflicted. While the weight hangs heavily, I keep time and measure, 
like a clock; but remove it, and all the springs and wheels move 
irregularly, and I am but a mere useless thing."</p>

<p><i>Halley's Comet</i>&mdash;&mdash;so, so.</p>

<p><i>Epimanes</i>. By Edgar A. Poe&mdash;an historical tale in which, by 
imaginary incidents, the character of Antiochus Epiphanes is vividly 
depicted. It differs essentially from all the other tales of Mr. 
Poe. Indeed no two of his articles bear more than a family 
resemblance to one another. They all differ widely in matter, and 
still more widely in manner. <i>Epimanes</i> will convince all who read 
it that Mr. P. is capable of even higher and better things.</p>

<p><i>Manual Labor Schools&mdash;By the Rev. E. F. Stanton</i> is an essay 
which, while we disagree with it in some of its results, will serve 
to convince any one of the absolute importance of exercise to men of 
sedentary habits or occupations.</p>

<p><i>Song of Lee's Legion</i>&mdash;very spirited verses.</p>

<p><i>Natural Bridge of Pandi</i>, and <i>Fall of Tequendama</i> are both 
acceptable articles.</p>

<p><i>Lines on the Statue of Washington in the Capitol</i>, although a 
little rugged in conclusion, are terse and forcible, and embody many 
eloquent sentiments. We recognize one of our most distinguished 
men&mdash;a fellow-townsman too&mdash;in the nerve and vigor of these verses. 
The <i>Epigram</i> below them is not worth much.</p>

<p><i>The Patriarch's Inheritance</i>&mdash;majestic and powerful.</p>

<p><i>Americanisms</i>&mdash;a very good article, and very true.</p>

<p><i>To Randolph of Roanoke</i>. These lines have some fine points and the 
versification is good&mdash;but we do not like them upon the whole.</p>

<p><i>Judge Tucker's Address</i>, and <i>Mr. Maxwell's Speech</i> before the 
Virginia Historical and Philosophical society, we read with much 
interest. Things of this nature are apt to be common place unless 
the speakers are men of more than ordinary <i>tact</i>. There is no 
deficiency, however, in the present instance. Mr. Maxwell's speech, 
especially, is exceedingly well adapted to produce effect in 
delivery&mdash;more particularly in such delivery as Mr. Maxwell's.</p>

<p>The <i>Address of Professor Dew</i> is, beyond doubt, an article of great 
ability, and must excite strong attention, wherever it is read. It 
occupies full 20 pages&mdash;which, perhaps, could not have been better 
occupied. He has fully proved that a Republic such as ours, is the 
fairest field in the world for the growth and florescence of Literature.</p>

<p>The <i>Critical Notices</i> maintain their lofty reputation&mdash;but as they 
will assuredly be read by all parties, and as we have already 
exceeded our limits, we forbear to enter into detail. The Messenger 
is no longer a query, it has earned a proud name. It demands 
encouragement and <i>will have it</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger for February</i>, is before us. It is 
made up, as usual, of a very interesting miscellany of original 
articles. This magazine is rapidly winning a high estimate for the 
literature of the South. Its pages contain as good articles as any 
other Monthly in the country. Its correspondents are numerous and 
able, and its editor wields the gray goose quill like one who knows 
what he is about, and who has a right to. Commend us to the literary 
notices of this Magazine for genius, spice and spirit. Those which 
are commendatory, are supported by the real merit of the books 
themselves; but woe seize on the luckless wights who feel the savage 
skill with which the editor uses his tomahawk and scalping knife. 
The fact is, the Messenger is not given to the mincing of 
matter&mdash;what it has to say is said fearlessly.</p>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;This elegantly printed Magazine 
is issued monthly from the classic press of T. W. White, Esq. 
Richmond, Va., and has, during the year elapsed since its 
commencement, won a commanding share of public approbation and 
attention. It is truly a high-minded and liberal specimen of 
southern literature, on which is deeply engraved the impressions of 
Southern character and feeling. We admire the periodical more on 
that account. It has a glow of enthusiasm, offering to the public, 
if not the very best, yet the best productions it can command, with 
a sort of chivalrous hospitality which cannot but remind one of the 
gentlemanly southron at his fireside.</p>

<p>Among the contributions of original articles for this magazine we 
cannot but notice the able historical papers entitled "Sketches of 
the history and present condition of Tripoli, with some account of 
the other Barbary states." These finely written papers have appeared 
in ten consecutive numbers of the Literary Messenger, and, together 
with "Extracts from my Mexican Journal," and "Extracts from an 
unpublished abridgement of the History of Virginia," furnish a 
valuable mass of the most useful information. The poetic writers for 
the Messenger, as a whole, are not the favorites of the Muses, and 
will no doubt be summoned to give an account of the cruel manner in 
which they have distorted the pure English in giving utterance to 
the spasmodic emotions of the <i>fytte</i> which they may have imagined 
was upon them like an inspiration.</p>

<p>There is one department which we admire&mdash;the editorial criticisms. 
Racy, pungent, and reasonable, the editor writes as one disposed to 
test the true elements of authorship, and to weigh pretentions with 
achievements in the opposite scale. He has gently, yet with almost 
too daring a hand, taken apart the poetical attire of two or three 
ladies, whose writings have long been ranked among the better 
specimens of American poetry. He almost dares to hint that Mrs. 
Sigourney has, by forcing her short scraps of poetry into half the 
newspapers in the land, gained a wider fame than many a better poet 
who may have spent a life in maturing and polishing one poem which 
appears to the world, as poems should, in a dignified volume. He 
also makes the same charge of the "<i>frequency</i> of her appeals to the 
attention of the public" against Miss Gould, and institutes the 
following comparison between the productions of the two authors: 
'The faults which we have already pointed out, and some others which 
we will point out hereafter, are but dust in the balance, when 
weighed against her (Mrs. Sigourney's) very many and distinguished 
excellences. Among those high qualities which give her beyond doubt, 
a title to the sacred name of poet, are an acute sensibility to 
natural loveliness&mdash;a quick and perfectly just conception of the 
moral and physical sublime&mdash;a calm and unostentatious vigor of 
thought&mdash;a mingled delicacy and strength of expression&mdash;and above 
all, a mind nobly and exquisitely attuned to all the gentle 
charities and lofty pieties of life.</p>

<p>'We have already pointed out the prevailing characteristics of Mrs. 
Sigourney. In Miss Gould, we recognize, first, a disposition, like 
that of Wordsworth, to seek beauty where it is not usually 
sought&mdash;in the <i>homeliness</i> (if we may be permitted the word,) and 
in the most familiar realities of existence&mdash;secondly <i>abandon</i> of 
manner&mdash;thirdly a phraseology sparkling with antithesis, yet, 
strange to say, perfectly simple and unaffected.</p>

<p>'Without Mrs. Sigourney's high reach of thought, Miss Gould 
surpasses her rival in the mere vehicle of thought&mdash;expression. 
"Words, words, words," are the true secret of her strength. <i>Words</i> 
are her kingdom&mdash;and in the realm of language she rules with equal 
despotism and <i>nonchalance</i>. Yet we do not mean to deny her 
abilities of a higher order than any which a mere <i>logomachy</i> can 
imply. Her powers of imagination are great, and she has a faculty of 
inestimable worth, when considered in relation to effect&mdash;the 
faculty of holding ordinary ideas in so novel, and sometimes in so 
fantastic a light, as to give them all the appearance, and much of 
the value of originality. Miss Gould will, of course, be the 
favorite with the multitude&mdash;Mrs. Sigourney with the few.'</p>

<p>American prose writers and novelists are led under this keen 
critic's knife, as sheep to the slaughter. In the name of literature 
we thank Mr. White for his criticisms, that must purify the 
literary, as lightning does the natural atmosphere.</p>

<p>The Southern Literary Messenger is published on the first day of 
every month, containing 64 pages in each number, printed on good 
paper with a beautiful type. The terms are only <i>five dollars a 
year</i>, to be paid in advance.</p>

<p><i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;"We have received the first number 
of the 2d volume of this valuable periodical. This work has justly 
acquired a reputation superior to that of any similar publication in 
the country, on account both of its elegant typographical execution, 
and the rich, valuable, and highly entertaining matter (mostly 
original) it contains. In the neatness and beauty of its 
typographical appearance, the number before us surpasses any of its 
predecessors; and its contents fully sustain its high literary 
character. We have no room at present for a particular notice of the 
articles. We hope that every Southron, who feels an interest in that 
sort of <i>internal improvement</i> in the South, which respects the 
mind, will patronize this work."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25">

<center><small>From the Columbia (Geo.) Times.</small></center>

<p><i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;We have received, some time since, 
and wished to have given an earlier notice to, this really excellent 
journal; at whose copiousness, variety and goodness of matter, we 
were surprized. In literary execution, we think it fully equal to 
any Journal of its class, in all the North; and in quantity of 
matter, it far exceeds, we believe, any of them. It is also on a 
full equality with them, as to its typography.</p>

<p>We are struck, in the <i>Messenger</i>, with this good point: the extent 
of literary intelligence which it affords, by an unusual number of 
critical notices of new publications, is exceedingly well judged. 
Its criticisms, too, are in a sounder and more discriminating taste, 
than that which infects the Magazines of the North, turning them all 
into the mere vehicles of puffery for each man's little set of 
associates in scribbling&mdash;and partners in literary iniquity. The 
Messenger has also this feature, almost indispensable for a 
successful Magazine, its Editorial articles are decidedly the best 
that it contains. They seem to be almost uniformly good.</p>

<p>We had intended to give some extracts from the Messenger: but the 
claims of more pressing matters compel us to postpone them. It is 
published in Richmond (Va.) by Thomas W. White, contains 64 large 
pages, in double columns, with small type; and is published monthly, 
at $5 per annum.</p>

<p>The number of the Southern Literary Messenger for March, has just 
made its appearance, having been delayed in order to insert an 
excellent address delivered by Professor Dew, of William and Mary 
College, upon the influence of the federative republican system of 
government upon literature and the developement of character. There 
are various articles which may be read with equal pleasure and 
profit. A short one upon "Americanisms" alludes to the word <i>avid</i>, 
employed by Bulwer in his last production, the hero of which is said 
to have been avid of personal power: and, the writer thinks it is 
the coinage of the novelist, as he says he can find no authority for 
it even in the latest dictionaries, nor in any author of repute. It 
does not, however, proceed from Mr. Bulwer's mint. As far as we are 
aware, Sir Egerton Brydges&mdash;who though not a first rate, is no mean 
member of the scribbling confraternity&mdash;is the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"><small><small>[p. 345]</small></small></a></span> first who has 
employed it. His Autobiography, published a few years ago, and which 
by the way, ought to have been re-published here as one of the most 
interesting and singular works of the time, contains it often enough 
to prove some feeling towards it in the author's breast akin to that 
of paternal affection.</p>

<p>As the review of the book which appeared in the Edinburgh Quarterly, 
was attributed to Bulwer, it is very probable that he fell in love 
with it when engaged in the task of criticism&mdash;a moment when, it 
ought to be inferred he was particularly alive to the correctness or 
incorrectness of any intrusion upon the premises of the King's 
English. The word is unquestionably a good and expressive one, and 
has quite as much inherent right to be incorporated with our 
language as any other Latin excrescence. It is only "Hebrew roots," 
we are informed by high authority, that "flourish most in barren 
ground." No imputation, therefore, rests upon the soil from which 
this sprang. Upon the subject of coining words, as upon so many 
others, old Flaccus has spoken best:</p>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;We have received the March No. 
of this valuable monthly. It is as rich in matter, and its pieces

of the Potomac, are superior to it.</p>

<p><i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;We have received the <i>Southern

collection of autographs will be examined with much interest. We can 
safely recommend this periodical to the patronage of the public.</p>

<p><i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;We have received the last number of 
this beautiful and valuable Magazine, and take great pleasure in 
expressing the delight with which we have perused its contents. It 
is certainly the best Magazine now published in the Union, and is an 
honor to Southern literature and talent. The present number like its 
predecessors, is replete with 'pearls, and gems, and flowers,' and 
fully sustains the elevated character of the work. The Critical 
Notices are peculiarly meritorious and sensible. The Messenger is 
now under the editorial guidance of Edgar A. Poe, a gentleman highly 
distinguished for his literary taste and talent.</p>

<p><i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;We have been furnished, by the 
worthy publisher, with the February number of this "best of American 
periodicals," as it is said to be by a distinguished Northern 
contemporary. This number is pronounced, in all of the many notices 
which we have seen, to be the best of the fifteen that have been 
published; of this we are not competent to decide, not having been 
favored with the previous numbers; but, be it as it may, we 
cheerfully coincide in the annexed sentiment of the editor of the 
Pennsylvanian:&mdash;"If it is not well supported by our brethren of the 
South, no faith is to be placed in their sectional feeling; <i>it is 
vox et præterea nihil</i>."</p>

<p>The Southern Literary Messenger for March, full of good matter, is 
at hand&mdash;delayed with a view of giving the whole of Professor Dew's

production of good books. We who publish no volumes, look with 
complacency upon severe criticism.</p>

<p>The writer of the following judicious article, has performed a task 
for which he is entitled to our thanks. A want of time and a lack of 
the proper talent for criticism, have prevented us from giving our 
opinion at length upon the last number of the Messenger; and this 
sketch saves us the labor. We accord with most of the writer's 
positions, and are pleased with the good sense, moderation and 
delicacy with which he has discharged the office of censor. 
Criticism, to be useful, must be just and impartial. This is both.</p>

<blockquote><small>"<i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>."&mdash;Virginia has cause of 
exultation that her chief literary periodical bearing the above 
title, has already attained a respectable rank in the United States, 
and has won "golden opinions" from some of the highest dignitaries 
in the empire of criticism. Whilst I do not think that the February 
number which has just appeared, is superior to all its predecessors, 
yet it may be considered a fair specimen of the general ability with 
which the work is conducted. Its contents are copious&mdash;various in 
their style and character, and, in candor be it spoken, of very 
unequal merit. Whilst some articles are highly interesting&mdash;the 
readers of the Messenger would have lost but little, if others had 
been omitted. This remark is not made in the spirit of fault 
finding; the Messenger has always <i>enough</i> in its pages to admire, 
without coveting an indiscriminate and unqualified praise of all 
which it contains.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The very first article in the February number, on the importance of 
<i>Selection in Reading</i>, though short, contains much matter for grave 
reflection. The writer states, and states truly, that if a man has 
forty years to employ in reading, and reads fifty pages a day, he 
will only be able in that period of time, to accomplish about 
<i>sixteen hundred</i> volumes of 500 pages each. Highly favored as such 
a man would be, beyond the mass of his fellow creatures, how 
insignificant the number of volumes read by him, compared with the 
millions which fill the libraries of the world, and the thousands 
and tens of thousand that continually drop from the press. How 
vastly important is it, therefore, to be well directed in the choice 
of books!&mdash;and I may add, how great is the responsibility of those 
whose province it is so to direct; to whom the task has been 
confided of selecting our literary food, and of separating what is 
healthful and nutritious from what is poisonous and hurtful. A well 
established magazine, or periodical, undoubtedly exercises great 
influence on the literary taste, as well as the literary morality of 
the circle of its readers. Hence good taste, good feeling&mdash;just 
discrimination and high rectitude, are essential qualities in the 
conduction of such a work. That Mr. Poe, the reputed editor of the 
Messenger, is a gentleman of brilliant genius and endowments, is a 
truth which I believe, will not be controverted by a large majority 
of its readers. For one, however, I confess, that there are 
occasionally manifested some errors of judgment&mdash;or faults in 
taste&mdash;or whatever they may be called, which I should be glad to see 
corrected. I do not think, for example, that such an article as "the 
Duc De L'Omelette," in the number under consideration, ought to have 
appeared. That kind of writing, I know, may plead high precedents in 
its favor; but that it is calculated to produce effects permanently 
injurious to sound morals, I think will not be doubted by those who 
reflect seriously upon the subject. Mr. Poe is too fond of the 
wild&mdash;unnatural and horrible! Why will he not permit his fine genius 
to soar into purer, brighter, and happier regions? Why will he not 
disenthral himself from the spells of German enchantment and 
supernatural imagery? There is room enough for the exercise of the 
highest powers, upon the multiform relations of human life, without 
descending into the dark mysterious and unutterable creations of 
licentious fancy. When Mr. Poe passes from the region of shadows, 
into the plain practical dissecting room of criticism, he manifests 
great dexterity and power. He exposes the imbecility and rottenness 
of our <i>ad captandum</i> popular literature, with the hand of a master. 
The public I believe was much delighted with the admirable scalping 
of "Norman Leslie," in the December number, and likewise of Mr. 
Simms' "Partisan," in the number for January; and it will be no less 
pleased at the caustic severity with which the puerile abortion of 
"Paul Ulric" is exposed in the present number.&mdash;These miserable 
attempts at fiction, will bring all fictitious writing into utter 
disrepute, unless indeed the stern rebukes which shall come from our 
chairs of criticism, shall rectify the public taste, and preserve 
the purity of public feeling.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>It would be tedious to pronounce upon the merits and demerits of the 
several articles in the number under review. Dr. Greenhow's 
continuation of the Tripolitan Sketches is worthy of his calm and 
philosophical pen. The re-appearance of "Nugator" in the pages of 
the Messenger&mdash;after a long interval of silence&mdash;will be hailed by 
its readers with great pleasure; his "Castellanus" is excellent. The 
article on "Liberian Literature," will attract much attention. It 
presents a very vivid picture of the wonderful progress which that 
colony has made in most of the arts, and in many of the refinements 
of life. Lionel Granby&mdash;the sketch of the lamented Cushing,&mdash;and the 
sketches of Lake Superior, have each their peculiar merits, and will 
be read with interest; of the <i>Critical Notices</i>, the sarcastic 
power of the review of Paul Ulric, has been already spoken of. The 
Review of "Rienzi," too, the last novel of Bulwer, is written in Mr. 
Poe's best style,&mdash;but I must be permitted to dissent <i>toto cælo</i> 
from his opinion, that the author of that work is unsurpassed as a 
novelist by any writer living or dead.&mdash;There is no disputing about 
tastes, but according to my poor judgment, a single work might be 
selected from among the voluminous labors of Walter Scott, worth all 
that Bulwer has ever written, or ever will write&mdash;and this I 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"><small>[p. 346]</small></a></span>
believe will be the impartial verdict of posterity, at least so long 
as unaffected simplicity and the true moral sublime, are preferred 
to the gaudy and meretricious coloring which perverted genius throws 
around its creations. The Eulogy on the great and good Marshall, is 
an elaborate and elegant performance. It is a powerful, yet familiar 
sketch of the principal features in the life and character of that 
incomparable man. The notices of Emilia Harrington; Lieutenant 
Slidell's work, the <i>American in England;</i> <i>Conti;</i> the <i>Noble Deeds 
of Women;</i> of <i>Roget's Physiology</i>, (one of the Bridgewater 
Treatises) and of Mathew Carey's <i>Auto-Biography</i>&mdash;are all very 
spirited articles, and are greatly superior to papers of the same 
description in the very best monthly periodicals of our country. The 
last article "Autography" is not exactly to my taste, though there 
are doubtless many who would find in it food for merriment. The 
writer of "Readings with My Pencil, No. 1,"&mdash;contests the generally 
received maxim of Horace, that poets are born such; in other words, 
he denies that there is an "original, inherent organization" of the 
mind which leads to the "high Heaven of invention," or which, 
according to the phrenologists, confers the faculty of "ideality." 
It would require too much space to prove that Horace was right, and 
that his assailant is altogether wrong. Mr. J. F. O. is greatly 
behind the philosophy of the age. It is too late in the day to prove 
that Shakespeare and Byron were created exactly equal with the 
common mass of mankind, and that <i>circumstances</i> made them superior. 
Circumstances may excite and <i>develope</i> mental power, but cannot 
create it. Napoleon, although not born Emperor of the French, was 
originally endowed with that great capacity which fitted him to 
tread the paths of military glory and to cut out his way to supreme 
power. Ordinary mortals could not have achieved what he did, with 
circumstances equally favorable, or with an education far superior.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>It is gratifying to learn that the "Messenger" is still extending 
the circle of its readers. The wonder is,&mdash;supposing that we have 
some love of country left on this side of the Potomac,&mdash;that its 
patronage is not overflowing. It is the only respectable periodical, 
I believe, south of that river; and with due encouragement, it might 
not only become a potent reformer of literary taste, but the vehicle 
of grave and solid instruction upon subjects deeply interesting to 
the southern country. That with all our never-ending professions of 
patriotism, however, there exists a vast deal more of selfishness 
than public spirit, even in our sunny clime, is a lamentable 
truth,&mdash;nor for one, am I sufficiently sanguine to unite with the 
editor of the Messenger, in the answer which he gives to his own 
interrogatory in the following eloquent passage, extracted from the 
Review of "Conti;"&mdash;"How long shall mind succumb to the grossest 
materiality? How long shall the veriest vermin of the earth who 
crawl around the altar of Mammon be more esteemed of men, than they, 
the gifted ministers to those exalted emotions which link us with 
the mysteries of Heaven? To our own query we may venture a reply. 
Not long&mdash;not long will such rank injustice be committed, or 
permitted. A spirit is already abroad at war with it. And in every 
billow of the unceasing sea of change&mdash;and in every breath, however 
gentle, of the wide atmosphere of revolution encircling us, is that 
spirit steadily, yet irresistibly at work." Alas! for this sea of 
change and this atmosphere of revolution which are fast surrounding 
us! For my part, I fear that all other distinctions but <i>wealth</i> and 
<i>power</i> are about to be annihilated. What do we behold indeed in 
society, but one universal struggle to acquire both? Moral and 
intellectual worth are but lightly esteemed in comparison with the 
possession of that sordid dross, which every brainless upstart or 
every corrupt adventurer may acquire.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>Though the Muses occupy a small space in the present number of the 
Messenger, their claims are not to be disregarded. Miss Draper's 
"Lay of Ruin," and Mr. Flint's "Living Alone" have both decided 
merit. The "Ballad" is written by one who can evidently write much 
better, if he chooses; and there is a deep poetical inspiration 
about Mr. Poe's "Valley Nis," which would be more attractive if his 
verses were smoother, and his subject matter less obscure and 
unintelligible. Mr. Poe will not consent to abide with ordinary 
mortals.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>Upon the whole, the last number of the Messenger is one of decided 
merit.</small></blockquote>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>. Our critical correspondent of the 
22d, is not borne out, in some of his remarks, by public opinion. We 
allude to his observations on the <i>Duc de L'Omelette</i>, and Mr. Poe's 
<i>Autography</i>. These articles are eliciting the highest praise from 
the highest quarters. Of the Duc de L'Omelette, the Baltimore 
American, (a paper of the first authority and hitherto opposed to 
Mr. P.) says: "The Duc de L'Omelette, by Edgar A. Poe, is one of 
those light, spirited, fantastic inventions, of which we have had 
specimens before in the Messenger, betokening a fertility of 
imagination, and power of execution, that would, under a sustained 
effort, produce creations of an enduring character." The Petersburg 
Constellation copies the entire "<i>Autography</i>," with high 
commendations, and of the Duc de L'Omelette, says, "of the lighter 
contributions, of the diamonds which sparkle beside the more sombre 
gems, commend us, thou spirit of eccentricity! to our favorite, 
Edgar A. Poe's '<i>Duc de L'Omelette</i>,' the best thing of the kind we 
ever have, or ever expect to read." These opinions seem to be 
universal. In justice to Mr. Poe, and as an offsett to the remarks 
of our correspondent, we extract the following notice of the 
February number from the National Intelligencer.</p>

<center><small>From the National Intelligencer.</small></center>

<blockquote><small><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>. The February No. of this 
beautiful and interesting periodical has reached us, and it gives us 
pleasure to learn that it will be distributed to a greater number of 
subscribers than any previous one has been. This is creditable to 
the taste of the people, to the industry of the proprietor, the 
talents of its editor and contributors, and particularly to the 
South, to whom Mr. White especially looks for the support of his 
enterprise. The following notice of the contents of the present 
number is from a friend of literary taste and discrimination:</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The present number is uncommonly rich. It opens with some valuable 
hints upon the necessity of selection in reading, a capital 
discourse of a column and a half upon the startling text, "if you 
have forty years to employ in reading, and can read fifty pages a 
day, you will be able in those forty years to accomplish only about 
<i>sixteen hundred volumes</i>, of 500 pages each." This consideration, 
ably put by the editor, is an antidote, one would think, to 
"smattering." The next is No. X. of a very interesting series of 
Historical sketches of Barbary States. This number brings the 
history of Algiers down to the close of Charles Xth's reign. Taken 
together, these papers are very valuable, and will form a useful 
reference hereafter. It is such papers as these that make a 
periodical worth keeping. The next prose article is amusing. It is a 
translation from the French, and gives a most humorous account of "a 
Cousin of the Married," a man who acquired that quaint <i>sobriquet</i> 
by attending all weddings, where there was a large company assembled 
and making himself useful by proposing sentiments, reciting 
<i>epithalamia</i>, and singing songs appropriate to those happy 
occasions, until he was discovered by an aristocratic groom, and 
compelled to vacate the premises. The paper contains a similar 
narrative of "a Cousin of the Dead," who, having been advised to 
ride for his health, and being too poor, used to go to all funerals 
as a mourner, and thus obtained the medicine prescribed by his 
physician, with no other cost than a few crocodile tears. Then comes 
one of that eccentric writer, <i>Edgar A. Poe's</i>, characteristic 
productions, "<i>The Duc de L'Omelette</i>," which is one of the best 
things of the kind we have ever read. <i>Mr. Poe</i> has great powers, 
and every line <i>tells</i> in all he writes. He is no spinner-out of 
long yarns, but chooses his subject, whimsically, perhaps, yet 
originally, and treats it in a manner peculiarly his own. "Rustic 
Courtship in New England" has not the verisimilitude which is 
necessary to entitle it to the only praise that such sketches 
usually obtain; unless they were well done, it were always better 
that Yankee stories be not done at all. We hate to be over-critical, 
but would recommend to the "<i>Octogenarian</i>" to take the veritable 
<i>Jack Downing</i> or <i>John Beedle</i>, as his models, before he writes 
again. Those inimitable writers have well-nigh, if not quite, 
exhausted the subject of New England Courtship, and (we speak "as 
one having authority, and not as the scribes," by which we mean the 
critics) the writer before us has done but very indifferently what 
they have done so well, as to gain universal applause. "Palæstine" 
is a useful article, containing geographical, topographical, and 
other statistical facts in the history of that interesting county, 
well put together, and valuable as a reference.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>We were much entertained with "<i>Nugator's</i>" humorous sketches of the 
castle-building farmer. No periodical in the country, numbers one 
among its contributors more racy than "Nugator." The article on 
"Liberian Literature" gives the reader a very flattering idea of the 
condition of that colony. The "Biographical Sketch" of <i>President 
Cushing</i>, of Hampden Sidney College, we read with much pleasure. We 
would recommend a series of similar sketches, from the same hand: 
nothing can give a periodical of this kind more solid value than 
such tributes to departed worth. Sketches of "Lake 
Superior"&mdash;beautiful! beautiful! We feel inclined to follow the 
track so picturesquely described by <i>Mr. Woolsey</i>, and make a 
pilgrimage to the wild and woody scenery of the Great Lake. This is 
a continuous series of letters, and we shall hail the coming numbers 
with much pleasure. The last prose <i>contribution</i> in the book is 
entitled "Readings with my Pencil," being a series of paraphrases of 
different passages, taken at random, from various authors. We like 
this plan, and think well of the performance thus far. It is to be 
continued.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The poetical department is not so rich as that in former numbers. 
<i>Miss Draper's</i> "Lay of Ruin" is irregular in the versification, and 
shows the fair writer's forte to be in a different style altogether. 
We wish she would give us something more like that gem of the 
December number of the Messenger, "Halley's Comet in 1760." <i>Mr. 
Flint's</i> "Living Alone," capital; and <i>Mr. Poe's</i> "Valley Nis," 
characteristically wild, yet sweetly soft and smooth in measure as 
in mood. The "Lines" on page 166 do no credit to the Messenger; they 
should have been dropped into the fire as soon as the first stanza 
was read by the editor; and if he had gotten to the eleventh, he 
should have sent the MS. to the Museum as a curiosity. Look! The 
Bard addresses the Mississippi!</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>This is altogether too bad. <i>Eliza's</i> Stanzas to "Greece" are very 
beautiful. She writes from <i>Maine</i>, and, with care and cultivation, 
will, by and by, do something worthy of the name to which she makes 
aspiration. So much for the poetry of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"><small>[p. 347]</small></a></span> number; which 
neither in quantity or quality is equal to the last three or four.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>In the "Editorial" department, we recognise the powerful 
discrimination of <i>Mr. Poe</i>. The dissection of "Paul Ulric," though 
well deserved, is perfectly savage. <i>Morris Mattson, Esq.</i> will 
hardly write again. This article will as surely kill him as one not 
half so scalpingly written did poor <i>Keats</i>, in the London 
Quarterly. The notice of <i>Lieutenant Slidell's</i> "American in 
England" we were glad to see. It is a fair offset to the coxcombical 
article (probably written by <i>Norman Leslie Fay</i>) which lately 
appeared in the New York Mirror, in reference to our countryman's 
really agreeable work. <i>Bulwer's</i> "Rienzi" is ably reviewed, and in 
a style to beget in him who reads it a strong desire to possess 
himself immediately of the book itself. There is also an interesting 
notice of <i>Matthew Carey's</i> Autobiography, and two or three other 
works lately published.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>Under this head, there is, in the number before us, the best sketch 
of the character and life of <i>Chief Justice Marshall</i> we have as yet 
seen. This alone would make a volume of the Messenger valuable 
beyond the terms of subscription. It purports to be a Review of 
<i>Story's</i>, <i>Binney's</i>, and <i>Snowden's</i> Eulogies upon that 
distinguished jurist, while, in reality, it is a rich and pregnant 
Biography of "The Expounder of the Constitution."</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The number closes with a most amusing paper containing twenty-five 
admirably executed <i>fac simile</i> autographs of some of the most 
distinguished of our literati. The <i>equivoque</i> of <i>Mr. Joseph A. B. 
C. D. E. F. G.</i> &amp;c. <i>Miller</i> is admirably kept up, and the whimsical 
character of the pretended letters to which the signatures are 
attached is well preserved. Of almost all the autographs we can 
speak on our own authority, and are able to pronounce them capital.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>Upon the whole, the number before us (entirely original) may be set 
down as one of the very best that has yet been issued.</small></blockquote>

<p>The Southern Literary Messenger, published in Richmond, maintains 
its high character. The March number, however, which has just come 
to hand, would have been the better had the solid articles been 
relieved, as in the previous numbers, by a greater variety of 
contributions of a lighter cast. It is comparatively heavy, a fault 
which should be carefully avoided in a magazine intended for all 
sorts of readers. Sinning in the opposite direction would be much 
more excusable.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25">

<center><small>From the Georgetown Metropolitan.</small></center>

<p>We have taken time to go through the last number of the Southern 
Literary Messenger, and find it, with some slight exceptions, in the 
articles of its correspondents, worthy, in every respect, of the 
high reputation of the series. The editorial articles are vigorous 
and original, as usual, and there are papers not easily to be 
surpassed in any periodical. Such a one is that on the Classics, 
which is not the saucy and flippant thing we were half afraid to 
find it, but an essay of great wisdom, learning, and strength,&mdash;and 
what we generally see combined with it,&mdash;playfulness of mind.</p>

<p>Another such article is the splendid address prepared by Professor 
Dew, for delivery before the Historical and Philosophical Society of 
Virginia. Its eloquence, vast compass, and subtlety of thought, will 
amply and richly repay the attention.</p>

<p>We have time to-day for but a brief notice of the other articles.</p>

<p>Sketches of the Barbary States,&mdash;continues the description of the 
French conquest, with the same clearness and ability which we have 
before frequently commended.</p>

<p>"Epimanes" displays a rich, but extravagant fancy.</p>

<p>"To Helen," is pretty and classic, from the same hand&mdash;we will give 
it in our next.</p>

<p>"Change" has many lines in it, of sweet, and what we like best, of 
thoughtful poetry; we will publish it in our next.</p>

<p>"Manual Labor Schools."&mdash;Another "address," but practical and 
sensible. We suggest, with deference, to the very able editor of the 
Southern Literary Messenger, that the less frequently he admits 
articles of this description into his columns, the better. Except in 
rare circumstances, such for example as Professor Dew's, we think 
they are unfit for a magazine,&mdash;the subject of the present one, is, 
however, of great importance. "Georgia Scenes" makes a capital 
article, and has excited, in our mind, a great curiosity to see the 
book.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25">

<center><small>From the Georgetown Metropolitan.</small></center>

<p>The Southern Literary Messenger, for the present month, is unusually 
rich. The articles evince depth, talent and taste, and there is all 
the eastern vigor and maturity of learning, with all the southern 
spirit of imagination. It is, in fact, nobly edited and supported, 
well worthy of being considered the representative and organ of 
Southern talent.</p>

<p>Of the articles in the present number, the general list as may be 
seen by looking at the advertisement in another column, is very 
attractive, and a perusal will not "unbeseem the promise." We have 
not time to go over each as we would wish; but the historical sketch 
of Algiers, which is brought down to the embarkation of the French 
expedition, will command attention. "A <i>Lay of Ruin</i>," by Miss 
Draper, has some lines of exquisite poetry, and Edgar A. Poe's 
Sketch "The Duc de L'Omelette," is the best thing of the kind we 
have seen from him yet. "Living Alone" by Timothy Flint, greatly 
interested us. That this patriarch of American literature, in his 
green and fresh old age, can write verses so full of the amaranthine 
vigor of youth, is a delightful picture. We are sorry we cannot find 
room for these pleasant verses. Among other attractions of the 
number, we come upon a Drinking Song, by Major Noah, in which the 
most agreeable and witty of editors, proves himself one of the most 
moral and fascinating of lyrists. It is an anacreontic of the right 
stamp, and does its author more credit than all the anti-Van Buren 
articles he ever penned.</p>

<p>The Critical Notices are better by far, than those in any other 
magazine in the country. Paul Ulric is too small game for the 
tremendous demolition he has received&mdash;a club of iron has been used 
to smash a fly. The article on Judge Marshall is an able and 
faithful epitome of that great jurist's character; in fact, the best 
which the press has yet given to the public. We agree with all the 
other critiques except that of Bulwer's Rienzi. The most 
extraordinary article in the book and the one which will excite most 
attention, is its tail piece, in which an American edition of 
Frazer's celebrated Miller hoax has been played off on the American 
Literati with great success&mdash;and better than all, an accurate fac 
simile of each autograph given along with it.</p>

<p>This article is extremely amusing, and will excite more attention 
than probably any thing of the kind yet published in an American 
periodical. It is quite new in this part of the world.</p>

<p>We commend this excellent magazine to our readers, as in a high 
degree deserving of encouragement, and as one which will reward it.</p>

<p>The <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> for February is, we think, the 
best of the fifteen numbers that have been published. Most of its 
articles, prose and verse, are of good Magazine quality, sprightly 
and diversified. The first, on "Selection in Reading," contains in a 
brief space a useful lesson in these book-abounding times, when many 
people take whatever publishers please to give them, or surrender 
their right of selection to the self-complacent and shallow editors 
of cheap "Libraries." Of the interesting "Sketches of the History 
and present condition of Tripoli, with some account of the other 
Barbary States," we have here No. 10, which concludes with the 
preparations of the attack on Algiers by the French in 1830. "The 
Cousin of the Married" and the "Cousin of the Dead" are two capital 
comic pictures from the French. "The Duc de L'Omelette, by Edgar A. 
Poe" is one of those light, spirited, fantastic inventions, of which 
we have had specimens before in the Messenger, betokening a 
fertility of imagination and power of execution, that with 
discipline could, under a sustained effort, produce creations of an 
enduring character. "Rustic Courtship in New England" is of a class 
that should not get higher than the first page of a country 
newspaper,&mdash;we mean no disrespect to any of our 
"cotemporaries,"&mdash;for it has no literary capabilities.</p>

<p>The best and also the largest portion of the present number of the 
Messenger is the department of critical notices of books. These are 
the work of a vigorous, sportive, keen pen, that, whether you 
approve the judgments or not it records, takes captive your 
attention by the spirit with which it moves. The number ends with 
the amusing Miller correspondence, of which we have already spoken.</p>

<p>We briefly announced a few days ago, the receipt of the February 
number of the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>. It is one of the 
richest and raciest numbers of that Journal yet issued from the 
Press. The judicious introductory article on the necessity of select 
reading; the continuation of the Historical sketches of the Barbary 
States; Palæstine; the Biographical notice of the late Professor 
Cushing of Hampden Sidney College; the Review of the Eulogies on, 
and Reminiscenses of the late Chief Justice Marshall, are among the 
solid treasures of the Messenger of this month. Sketches of Lake 
Superior in a series of Letters which are "<i>to be continued;</i>" the 
Cousin of the Married and the Cousin of the Dead, a translation from 
the French; Lionel Granby, Chapter 8; the Castle Builder turned 
Farmer, and Rustic Courtship in New England, have each their 
beauties, excellences and peculiarities. Of the lighter 
contributions, of the diamonds which sparkle beside the more sombre 
gems, commend us, thou spirit of eccentricity! forever and a day to 
our favorite Edgar A. Poe's <i>Duc de L'Omelette</i>&mdash;the best thing of 
the kind we ever have or ever expect to read. The idea of "dying of 
an Ortolan;" the waking up in the palace of Pluto; of that 
mysterious chain of "blood red metal" hung "<i> parmi les nues</i>," at 
the nether extremity of which was attached a "cresset," pouring 
forth a light more "intense, still and terrible" than "Persia ever 
worshipped, Gheber imagined, or Mussulman dreamed of;" the paintings 
and statuary of that mysterious hall, whose solitary uncurtained 
window looked upon blazing Tartarus, and whose ceiling was lost in a 
mass of "fiery-colored clouds;" the <i>nonchalance</i> of the <i>Duc</i> in 
challenging "His Majesty" to a <i>pass</i> with the <i>points;</i> his 
imperturbable, self-confident assurance during the playing of a game 
of <i>ecarté;</i> his adroitness in slipping a card while his Infernal 
Highness "took wine" (a trick which won the <i>Duc</i> his game by the 
by,) and finally his <i>characteristic</i> compliment to the Deity of the 
Place of "que s'il n'etait pas de L'Omelette, il n'aurait point 
d'objection d'etre le Diable," are conceptions which for peculiar 
eccentricity and graphic quaintness, are perfectly inimitable. Of 
the criticisms, the most are good; that on Mr. Morris Mattson's 
novel of "Paul Ulric," like a former criticism from the same pen on 
Fay's "Norman Leslie" is a literal "flaying alive!" a carving up 
into "ten thousand atoms!" a complete literary annihilation! If Mr. 
Morris <span class="pagenum"><a name="page348"><small><small>[p. 348]</small></small></a></span>
Mattson is either courageous or wise, he will turn upon 
his merciless assailant as Byron turned upon Jeffrey, and prove that 
he can not only do better things, but that he deserves more lenient 
usage! Last but not by far the least in interest, is Mr. Joseph A. 
Q. Z. Miller's "Autography." We copy the whole article as a literary 
treat which we should wrong their tastes did we suppose for a moment 
would not be as highly appreciated by each and all of our readers, 
as it is by ourself.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25">

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>. The last number of this 
periodical is, perhaps the best that has appeared, and shows that 
the favor with which its predecessors have been received has only 
added stimulus to the exertions of its enterprising proprietor and 
very able Editor. The number consists of 70 pages, all of which are 
taken up with original matter. The prose articles are generally of 
high merit&mdash;but the poetry of the present number is inferior to that 
of some of the preceding. The critical notices are written in a 
nervous style and with great impartiality and independence. The 
Editor seems to have borne in mind the maxim of the greatest of 
reviewers&mdash;"the judge is condemned when the guilty is acquitted." 
The application of this severe rule to all criticism would impart 
greater value to just commendation and render the censure of the 
press more formidable to brainless pretenders. The public judgment 
is constantly deluded and misled by indiscriminate puffing and 
unmerited praise. The present Editor of the Messenger is in no 
danger of doing violence to his feelings in this respect.</p>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;This is a periodical which it is 
probably well known to many of our readers, was established a little 
more than a year since, in Richmond, Va. It is issued in monthly 
numbers of about seventy pages each, and is devoted to every 
department of Literature and the Fine Arts. Containing much matter 
of a brilliant and superior order, evidently the productions of 
accomplished scholars and Belles Lettres writers, with able and 
discriminating critical notices of the principal publications on 
this side the Atlantic, the Southern Literary Messenger is equal in 
interest and excellence to any Monthly Periodical in the country, 
and we are glad to learn from the February number that it has 
already received extensive and solid patronage.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25">

<center><small>From the Norfolk Beacon.</small></center>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i> for February appears in all its 
freshness. The sketches of the history of the Barbary States 
contained in the present number include the period of the equipment 
and departure of the French fleet destined for the attack on 
Algiers. The account of the diplomatic movements of England and 
France on the subject of the proposed capture is novel and 
instructive. The tribute to the memory of Cushing we hail with 
pleasure. If it be not a faultless production, it is written in a 
right spirit. The review of Paul Ulric is written with great freedom 
and unusual severity. The reviewer wields a formidable weapon. The 
article on Judge Marshall groups within a small compass much 
valuable and interesting intelligence respecting the late Chief 
Justice. It is not executed, however in a workmanlike manner. The 
ungenerous allusion to Chapman Johnson was wholly gratuitous. There 
is also a seasoning of federal politics, not referring to long past 
times, that ought to have been spared us. But the article on 
Autography is a treat of no common order. We have seen nothing of 
the kind before in an American periodical. It must have cost Mr. 
White a great deal of labor and expense in its typographical 
execution. What has become of the excellent series of essays on the 
sexes, ascribed to the pen of a distinguished professor of Wm. &amp; Mary?</p>

<hr align="center" width="25">

<center><small>From the Baltimore American.</small></center>

<p>The publication of the Southern Literary Messenger, for March, was 
delayed beyond the usual time, for the purpose of inserting in it an 
Address by Professor Dew, of Wm. and Mary College, prepared to be 
delivered before the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society. 
The first copy sent to us having miscarried, we have been further 
disappointed in the receipt of this number, which has just now 
reached us. As yet we have read but one article in it, but that is 
one of such merit on so interesting a subject, that it were nearly 
sufficient alone to give value to the number, without the aid of Mr. 
Dew's Address, to which we shall hereafter refer, doubting not to 
find it of high excellence, as his reputation leads us to 
anticipate.</p>

<p>The article to which we allude is on 'Manual Labor Schools, and 
their importance as connected with literary institutions.' The 
introduction of manual labor as a regular department of the school 
exercises is, we believe, one of the greatest improvements of the 
age, in the most important branch of human endeavor&mdash;the <i>culture</i> 
of man. We make no apology for frequently recurring to this subject. 
As reasonable would it be to expect apologies from the municipal 
authorities for directing their efforts daily, and with unrelaxed 
watchfulness, to the keeping pure and healthy the atmosphere of a 
city. The culture or education of human beings is a subject of 
unsurpassed moment and of never ceasing interest. The principles 
upon which this culture is to be conducted, and the modes of 
applying them, involve the well being of communities and nations. We 
are glad therefore, to perceive, that in our new and promising race 
of literary monthlies, education receives a large share of attention.</p>

<p>The paper before us in the Messenger, prepared by the Rev. Mr. 
Stanton, is peculiarly interesting, because it embodies a quantity 
of experience of the results produced by manual labor&mdash;results, 
which though derived from comparatively few sources, the number of 
institutions where the system has been introduced being as yet 
small&mdash;are of the most emphatic and convincing character. They 
already suffice to prove that the connexion of manual labor 
establishments with literary institutions, is conducive not only in 
the highest degree to health, but to morals, and to intellectual 
proficiency. Moreover&mdash;and this is a point of incalculable 
importance&mdash;in some of these institutions, a <i>majority</i> of the 
students have by their labor diminished their expenses about one 
half; a portion of them have defrayed the whole of their expenses, 
and a few have more than defrayed them&mdash;enjoying at the same time 
better health, and making more rapid advances in knowledge than 
usual. The distinct testimony of the pupils as well as 
superintendents, is adduced to prove the beneficial effects upon 
body and mind, of three hours agricultural or mechanical labor every 
day. One of these effects is described in the following language. 
"This system is calculated to make men hardy, enterprising, and 
independent; and to wake up within them a spirit perseveringly to 
do, and endure, and dare."</p>

<p><i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i>.&mdash;The February No. of this 
periodical is before us&mdash;rich in typographical beauty as ever, but 
scarcely so fortunate as in some former instances in the character 
of its original contributions. Such at least is our judgment; and 
yet of some twenty articles the greater number will be perused with 
decided satisfaction. Of these, No. X. of the "<i>Sketches of the 
History of Tripoli</i>" and other Barbary States, affords an 
interesting account of the series of outrages on the part of the 
Algerine Regency which provoked the entire overthrow of that 
infamous banditti and the subjugation of the country. [We take 
occasion to say here that we trust France will <i>never</i> restore the 
Algerine territory to the sway of the barbarian and infidel, but 
hold it at the expense, if need be, of a Continental War.]</p>

<p>"<i>The Cousin of the Married and the Cousin of the Dead</i>" is a most 
striking translation, which we propose to copy.</p>

<p>"<i>Living Alone</i>," by Timothy Flint, forms an exception to the usual 
character of the poetry of the Messenger, which we do not greatly 
affect. Mr. Flint, however, writes to be read&mdash;and is rarely 
disappointed or disappoints his readers.</p>

<p>There are some amusing pictures of Virginia rural life and domestic 
economy in the papers entitled "Lionel Granby" and "Castellanus;" 
and the biographical sketch of the late President Cushing, of 
Hampden Sidney College, indicates a just State pride properly 
directed. The "Sketches of Lake Superior" are alike creditable to 
the writer and the Magazine. "Greece" forms the inspiration of some 
graceful lines. But the 'great feature' of this No. is an Editorial 
critique on Mr. Morris Mattson's novel of "Paul Ulric," which is 
tomahawked and scalped after the manner of a Winnebago. If any young 
gentleman shall find himself irresistibly impelled to perpetrate a 
novel, and all milder remedies prove unavailing, we earnestly advise 
him to read this criticism. We are not sufficiently hard hearted to 
recommend its perusal to any one else.</p>

<p>The concluding paper will commend itself to the attention of the 
rational curious. It embraces the autographs, quaintly introduced 
and oddly accompanied, of twenty-four of the most distinguished 
literary personages of our country&mdash;Mrs. Sigourney, Miss Leslie, 
Miss Sedgwick, Messrs. Washington Irving, Fitz Greene Halleck, 
Timothy Flint, J. K. Paulding, J. Fenimore Cooper, Robert Walsh, 
Edward Everett, J. Q. Adams, Dr. Channing, &amp;c. &amp;c. We note this as 
an evidence of the energy no less than the good taste of the 
publisher, and as an earnest of his determination to spare no pains 
or expense in rendering the work acceptable to its patrons.</p>

<p>The Southern Literary Messenger, for March, has been received, and a 
particularly good number it is. There is one point in which this 
Messenger stands pre-eminent, and that point is candor. If there is 
any thing disgusting and sickening, it is the fashion of magazine 
and newspaper reviewers of the present day of plastering every thing 
which is heralded into existence with a tremendous sound of 
trumpets&mdash;applaud every thing written by the twenty-fifth relation 
distant of a really great writer, or the author of one or two 
passable snatches of poetry, or every day sketches.</p>

<p>Last but not least, as the friends of a literature, emphatically 
<i>southern</i>, we welcome the February number of the "Southern Literary 
Messenger," a work that stands second to none in the country. Its 
criticisms we pronounce to be at once the boldest and most generally 
correct of any we meet with. True, it is very severe on many of the 
current publications of the day; but we think no unprejudiced man 
can say it is a whit too much so. The country is deluged from Maine 
to Louisiana, with a mass of <i>stuff</i> "done up" into <i>books</i> that 
<i>require</i> the most severe handling. The Messenger <i>gives it to

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
